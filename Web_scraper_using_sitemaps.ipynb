       " 'What is the infected blood scandal and will victims get compensation?': ['What is the infected blood scandal and will victims get compensation? Published 50 minutes ago Share close panel Share page Copy link About sharing Related Topics UK infected blood inquiry Image source, Getty Images By Jim Reed Health reporter More than 30,000 people in the UK were infected with HIV and hepatitis C after being given contaminated blood products in the 1970s and 1980s. A public inquiry has described the scale of the scandal as \"horrifying\" and accused doctors, the government and NHS of repeatedly failing patients. Victims are campaigning for billions of pounds in compensation, with the government due to set out details of payments on Tuesday. Who was given infected blood and how many died? Two main groups of NHS patients were affected by what has been called the biggest treatment disaster in the history of the NHS. Firstly, haemophiliacs - and those with similar disorders - who have a rare genetic condition which means their blood does not clot properly , external . People with haemophilia A have a shortage of a clotting agent called Factor VIII, while people with haemophilia B don\\'t have enough Factor IX. In the 1970s, a new treatment using donated human blood plasma was developed to replace these clotting agents. But whole batches were contaminated with deadly viruses. After being given the infected treatments, about 1,250 people in the UK with bleeding disorders developed both HIV and hepatitis C, including 380 children . This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Media caption, Colin Smith, who died aged seven, was one of 380 children now thought to have been infected with HIV through contaminated blood products. Around two-thirds later died of Aids-related illnesses. Some unintentionally gave HIV to their partners. Another 2,400 to 5,000 people developed hepatitis C on its own, which can cause cirrhosis and liver cancer. It is difficult to know the exact number of people infected with hepatitis C, partly because it can take decades for symptoms to appear. A second group of patients were given contaminated blood transfusions after childbirth, surgery or other medical treatment between 1970 and 1991. The inquiry estimates between 80 and 100 of these people were infected with HIV, and about 27,000 with hepatitis C. In total, it\\'s thought about 2,900 people have died. The Haemophilia Society believes 650 people infected with contaminated blood products, or their bereaved partners, have died since the inquiry was announced in 2017. What has the infected blood inquiry said? Announcing its findings, the inquiry said victims had been failed \"not once, but repeatedly\" , and that the risk of viral infections in blood products had been known since 1948. Inquiry chairman Sir Brian Langstaff said there had been a lack of openness from the authorities and elements of \"downright deception\", including the destruction of documents. He said half-truths were also told, so people did not know about the risk of their treatment, the availability of alternatives, or even whether they were infected. \"This disaster was not an accident,\" said Sir Brian. \"The infections happened because those in authority - doctors, the blood services and successive governments - did not put patient safety first.\" The report said , external : too little was done to stop importing blood products from abroad, which used blood from high-risk donors such as prisoners and drug addicts in the UK, blood donations were accepted from high-risk groups such as prisoners until 1986 blood products were not heat treated to eliminate HIV until the end of 1985, although the risks were known in 1982 there was too little testing to reduce the risk of hepatitis, from the 1970s onwards Will infected blood scandal victims get compensation? Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has promised to pay \"comprehensive compensation\" . Details will be announced on Tuesday and the total cost is likely to run into billions. The government has been criticised for waiting until after the publication of the report to announce what compensation will be offered. Bereaved families heckled the prime minister when he told the infected blood inquiry, in July 2023, that the government would act as \"quickly as possible\". In late 2022, following advice from the inquiry , the government made interim payments of £100,000 each to around 4,000 surviving victims and some bereaved partners. In April 2023, Sir Brian said interim compensation should also be offered to the children and parents of those infected. \\'Blood compensation comes too late for my husband\\' Infected blood inquiry: Read more LIVE: Follow all the latest news and updates Read more about the victims, families and what happened I lost mum, dad and sister to HIV in blood scandal The school where dozens died in NHS blood scandal Children used as \\'guinea pigs\\' in clinical trials Hundreds infected with hepatitis C without knowing it How did the infected blood scandal happen? In the 1970s, the UK was struggling to meet the demand for blood-clotting treatments, so imported supplies from the US. But much of the blood was bought from high-risk donors such as prison inmates and drug-users. Factor VIII was made by pooling plasma from tens of thousands of donors. If just one was carrying a virus, the entire batch could be contaminated. UK blood donations were not routinely screened for hepatitis C until 1991, 18 months after the virus was first identified. Image source, Jackie Britton Image caption, Jackie Britton, from Portsmouth, was infected with hepatitis C through a transfusion after the birth of her daughter in 1983 When did authorities know about infected blood? By the mid-1970s, there were repeated warnings that imported US Factor VIII carried a greater risk of infection. But attempts to make the UK more self-sufficient in blood products failed, so the NHS continued using foreign supplies. Campaigners say haemophiliacs could have been offered an alternative treatment called Cryoprecipitate. This was much harder to administer, but was made from the blood plasma of a single donor, lowering the infection risk. BBC News has also uncovered evidence children were infected with hepatitis C and HIV after being placed on clinical trials of new treatments - often, without their family\\'s consent. As late as November 1983, the government insisted there was no \"conclusive proof\" that HIV could be transmitted in blood, a line robustly defended by former health minister Ken Clarke when he appeared before the inquiry.

Media caption, Carolyn Challis: \"I got through two life-threatening rounds of cancer only to be given another life-threatening illness\" What happened in other countries affected by infected blood? Many other countries were affected, although some - including Finland - used older treatments until much later rather than switch to Factor VIII, which minimised HIV infections , external . Delivering the findings of the inquiry, Sir Brian Langstaff criticised UK government claims in the 1990s that screening for hepatitis C began as soon as the technology was available. He said that 23 other countries - including Japan, Finland and Spain - introduced the screening before the UK. In the US, companies that supplied infected products have paid out millions in out-of-court settlements. Politicians and drug companies have been convicted of negligence in countries including France and Japan. In his evidence to the inquiry, former health secretary Andy Burnham suggested there may be grounds for charges of corporate manslaughter , external in the UK.

       " 'ICC: Netanyahu angrily rejects move to seek his arrest': ['Netanyahu denounces bid to arrest him over Gaza war Image source, EPA Sam Cabral BBC News Reporting from Washington Published 20 May 2024 Updated 6 hours ago Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has angrily condemned the International Criminal Court\\'s prosecutor for seeking arrest warrants for him alongside Hamas\\'s leaders over alleged war crimes in the Gaza conflict. Mr Netanyahu said he rejected with disgust that \"democratic Israel\" had been compared with what he called \"mass murderers\". Mr Netanyahu\\'s comments have been echoed by US President Joe Biden, who said there was no equivalence between Israel and Hamas. The chief ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan, said there were reasonable grounds to believe that Mr Netanyahu and his Defence Minister Yoav Gallant bore criminal responsibility for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza. The ICC is also seeking a warrant for Hamas\\'s leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, for war crimes. Israel and the US, its key ally, are not members of the ICC, which was set up in 2002. Image source, EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock Image caption, Israel\\'s continuing offensive in the Gaza Strip has forced many Palestinians to flee their homes The accusations against the Israeli and Hamas leaders stem from the events of 7 October, when waves of Hamas gunmen attacked Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 252 others back to Gaza as hostages. The attack triggered the current war, in which at least 35,500 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, according to the territory\\'s Hamas-run health ministry. On Monday, Mr Biden said there was \"no equivalence - none - between Israel and Hamas\". \"It\\'s clear Israel wants to do all it can to ensure civilian protection,\" Mr Biden added. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken echoed the president\\'s condemnation, saying Washington \"fundamentally rejects\" the move. \"It is shameful,\" he said. \"[The] ICC has no jurisdiction over this matter.\" Mr Blinken also suggested the request for arrest warrants would jeopardise ongoing efforts to reach a ceasefire deal. Mr Khan also applied for arrest warrants for Mr Gallant and Hamas\\'s political leader Ismail Haniyeh, along with the group\\'s military chief Mohammed Deif. He said Israel\\'s prime minister and defence minister were suspected of crimes including starvation of civilians as a method of warfare, murder, intentionally directing attacks against a civilian population, and extermination. The prosecutor said the alleged crimes began \"from at least 7 October 2023\" in the Hamas leaders\\' case,  when the group launched its attack on Israel, and \"from at least 8 October 2023\" for the Israeli leaders. The ICC defended its stance on Monday, saying that despite \"significant efforts\"  it had not received \"any information that has demonstrated genuine action at the domestic level [in Israel] to address the crimes alleged or the individuals under investigation\". A panel of judges at the ICC must now consider whether to issue the warrants and, if they do, countries signed up to the ICC statute are obliged to arrest the men if they have such an opportunity. Image source, Reuters Image caption, Hamas\\'s deadly attack on 7 October devastated a number of Israeli settlements Mr Netanyahu, Israel\\'s longest-serving prime minister, condemned the application to seek his arrest as \"an absurd and false order\". In a public statement in Hebrew, he asked  \"with what audacity\" the ICC would \"dare to compare\" Hamas and Israel. The comparison was a \"distortion of reality\", Mr Netanyahu said. He accused the prosecutor of \"callously pouring gasoline on the fires of antisemitism that are raging across the world\". Israel\\'s Foreign Minister Israel Katz called the move by Mr Khan an \"unrestrained frontal assault\" on the victims of the 7 October attacks and a \"historical disgrace that will be remembered forever\". But some of Israel\\'s Western allies avoided directly criticising the ICC in their statements. In a statement late on Monday, the French foreign ministry said it supported the court and what it called its \"fight against impunity in all situations\". Similarly, Germany\\'s foreign ministry said it “respects the independence and procedures” of the ICC. However, Berlin did criticise the simultaneous publication of the charges against Israeli and Hamas leaders, saying the move \"created the incorrect impression of equivalency\". What is the International Criminal Court? Published 1 May Hamas earlier made its own demand for \"the cancellation of all arrest warrants issued against leaders of the Palestinian resistance\". \"Hamas strongly denounces the attempts of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court to equate the victim with the executioner,\" the group said. The group also complained that the application for warrants against Mr Netanyahu and Mr Gallant had come “seven months late”, and that other Israeli political and military leaders had not been named alongside them. Mr Khan accused the Hamas leaders of having committed crimes including extermination, murder, hostage taking, rape and sexual violence, and torture.

The woman was treated by paramedics at the home in Cornwall Close, Hornchurch, but died at the scene on Monday afternoon. The two dogs were seized by armed officers after being contained in a room. It is believed to be the first fatal attack by XL bully dogs that were known to have been registered under new laws. A blue forensic tent was put up outside the woman\\'s home in the small residential street following the attack. The family of the woman, who was the owner of the dogs, is being supported by officers, the Metropolitan Police says. From 1 February, it became an offence in England and Wales to own the XL bully breed without an exemption certificate. What is the XL bully ban and how dangerous are they? The government move to ban XL bullies followed a series of attacks on people. According to the Office for National Statistics, there were 16 deaths due to dog attacks in 2023, a sharp rise from preceding years where the number had been in single figures. Image caption, Local dog trainer Michaela Scott said most XL bully owners work to keep everyone and their dogs safe As of late 2023, around 60% of dogs held in police kennels were a bull breed of some kind. Dog trainer Michaela Scott, who lives near the house where the woman died in Hornchurch, said attacks like this could be scary for people who did not work with this breed. \"It\\'s really sad for the person, the neighbours, for the local community,\" she said. Ms Scott, who specialises in working with XL bully dogs, said there were \"quite a lot\" of people in the area with the breed. She said there had been a rise in demand from owners for her training program to help their dogs adapt to the new rules. \"Owners want to do what\\'s right for their dog,\" she said. \"They want to know how to keep their dog safe as well as everyone else safe.\" Anyone who owns one of the dogs must have the animal neutered and microchipped, and keep it muzzled and on a lead in public, among other restrictions.

Policy in Practice, a data analytics company, found that more than £2bn is being left unclaimed in Wales this year. Rhys Lewis, an adviser with Citizens Advice Caerphilly Blaenau Gwent said a team he works with recently helped a pensioner couple claim an extra £18,000 a year. The Department for Work and Pensions said the welfare system “supports millions every year” and they “promote benefits\" through campaigns and a helpline. How are universal credit rules changing? Published 13 May How much will benefits increase? Published 22 November 2023 Universal credit \\'must change\\' to tackle sickness Published 15 April Mr Lewis, from Rhymney, Caerphilly county, said the cost of living pressures of the last few years meant he and his colleagues saw “a big uptake” in people seeking help. “More people are needing to come in to maximise their income, which is something we do a lot, especially with benefits,” he said. According to data from Policy in Practice, at least £76m worth of benefits and other support is left unclaimed in the Caerphilly and Blaenau Gwent areas alone. The organisation estimates that across Britain £23bn is going unclaimed this year , external . But there are higher proportions of unclaimed benefits in some places including Wales, where there may be additional barriers to claiming, said Rachel Walker, director of policy and research at Policy in Practice. Image caption, Rachel Walker says there are many reasons why people may not claim the benefits they could be entitled to “There may be more poverty, there may be an older population, digital exclusion plays a massive role,\" Mrs Walker said. She added the rural nature of some communities could also make it more difficult for people to access services which can then help them claim support. The Policy in Practice figures suggest that at least £2.06bn in means tested benefits and other support is being unclaimed in Wales this year. That includes UK benefits such as Universal Credit, as well as support funded by the Welsh government and delivered by local authorities such as council tax support. It also included ways of reducing costs because receiving certain benefits means you qualify for reduced charges for services such as water and broadband. Barriers to claiming the right level of support can include a lack of awareness of what is available as well as the complexity of the welfare system. But claiming what you are eligible for can make a “massive difference” to people who have been struggling with rising prices over the last few years, said Mr Lewis. “It’s taken that worry away,\" he added. “People have said ‘I haven’t got to worry about watching the units on the gas and electric now’, and they can just feel comfortable in their homes and in life.” It can also mean less demand on public services, said Mrs Walker. “A pensioner who is claiming pension credit is less likely to draw on adult social services because they could heat their home,\" he said. “And when we look at children, we know that when we maximise working age benefits, educational attainment goes up, health goes up, weight comes down.” How to get help The Department for Work and Pensions provides links to some free, anonymous and independent benefits calculators , external provided by charities Call a free and confidential \"Claim What\\'s Yours\" , external benefits advice line on 0808 250 5700 But the figure of £2.06bn in unclaimed support in Wales could be an underestimate because it does not include disability benefits.

       " 'Greek migrant shipwreck: Questions surround trial of nine Egyptians': ['Questions surround trial of Greek shipwreck accused Image source, Greek Coast Guard Image caption, The overcrowded vessel was pictured a number of times before tragedy struck Nick Beake Europe Correspondent Reporting from Kalamata, southern Greece Kostas Kallergis Senior Europe Producer Reporting from Kalamata, southern Greece Published 21 May 2024, 00:06 BST Updated 2 hours ago As nine Egyptian men stand trial in Greece accused of causing the worst migrant shipwreck in the Mediterranean Sea for a decade, the BBC can reveal key discrepancies in the case against them. The accused face life in prison if convicted of people-smuggling and causing the sinking of the fishing boat last June in which as many as 600 people are feared to have drowned. The indictment obtained by the BBC shows the defendants are being prosecuted on evidence which has already been contradicted by at least six survivors who told us the coastguard had caused their boat to capsize and then pressured them to frame the Egyptians. Human rights groups, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have said they have strong reservations about the integrity of the Greek investigation and evidence and are asking whether the defendants will receive a fair trial. The Greek coastguard has constantly denied their actions brought about the disaster and the authorities have rejected all claims of wrongdoing or of a cover-up. Up to 500 feared lost at sea The nine defendants, who are Egyptian and aged between 20 and 41, went on trial on Tuesday in the southern Greek coastal city of Kalamata. The men were all on board the “Adriana” fishing boat that sank in international waters, but in Greece’s demarcated rescue area, in one of the deepest parts of the Mediterranean on 14 June last year. Eighty-two bodies were recovered, but the United Nations believes an additional 500 people - including 100 women and children who were in the hold of the boat - may have died. It’s estimated the boat was carrying up to 750 migrants when it set off nearly a week earlier from the port of Tobruk in Libya. The Greek coastguard had been following the boat for at least seven hours before the sinking happened but later said it did not attempt a rescue because the vessel was travelling safely at a “steady speed” and on a “steady course” to Italy and that passengers were not in danger. A previous BBC investigation cast serious doubt on these claims. When the BBC put our allegations to Greece’s prime minister last November, Kyriakos Mitsotakis said they were being investigated but that culpability rested with the smugglers. “Our coastguard has saved tens of thousands of people at sea and we should be grateful for the work they do,” Mr Mitsotakis said. Condition of the boat central to prosecution case The indictment obtained by the BBC reveals that Greek prosecutors accuse the nine Egyptians of causing the disaster by skippering an extremely overcrowded vessel which they knew posed an obvious danger to life. It reads: “The fishing vessel was not seaworthy as it was old and badly maintained and not fit to transfer such a large number of people, especially for such a huge distance while there were no life jackets.” The prosecution says each of the defendants took turns to steer the vessel and were all aware the severe overcrowding on both the deck and in the hold was badly affecting stability. Last summer the Greek coastguard responded to heavy criticism of its failure to do more to help the vessel  by insisting the migrant boat was safe and travelling steadily towards Italy and therefore and did not need to be rescued. Now though, nearly a year after the disaster, the Greek prosecution case will be based on an argument that directly contradicts the coastguard’s official account. Image source, Greek Coast Guard Image caption, This picture of the fishing boat in the hours before it sank was released by the coastguard on Thursday Claims Egyptian defendants framed The indictment also says that the nine Egyptian men were part of a smuggling gang and charged each passenger between $4,000 and $8,000 (£3,100-£6,300) for a spot on the boat. The prosecution’s charges are based on interviews, conducted by the coastguards themselves, of nine other survivors in the days after the disaster. No evidence from the other 95 survivors appears to have been submitted to the court. Our team previously heard claims that some of the 104 survivors were pressured into identifying the nine Egyptian men as traffickers. Two Syrian men, who we called Ahmad and Musaab to protect their identity, told us the coastguard had instructed them to keep quiet about other factors in the disaster and instead to blame these nine men. \"They were imprisoned and were wrongly accused by the Greek authorities as an attempt to cover their crime,\" said Musaab. In separate interviews in Athens, four other survivors told us they believed the Egyptians were paying passengers like them and had been framed. But other survivors are said to have stated they were indeed mistreated by some of the accused - who have been referred to as the Pylos Nine, drawing on the name of the Greek town of Pylos near the location of the sinking. Allegations against Greek coastguard not mentioned in indictment In the weeks after the disaster, multiple survivors claimed that a Greek patrol vessel had in fact caused the migrant boat to capsize in a last-ditch, botched attempt to tow it. This allegation is not mentioned anywhere in the court indictment even though the United Nations say the claims merit an independent investigation. The Naval Court in Greece is investigating possible wrongdoing on the part of the coastguard, which has consistently denied all allegations. Ahmad and Musaab, whom we interviewed last year, claimed they were silenced and intimidated by Greek authorities after suggesting the patrol vessel caused the sinking. \"They attached a rope from the left. Everyone moved to the right side of our boat to balance it,\" said Musaab. \"The Greek vessel moved off quickly causing our boat to flip. They kept dragging it for quite a distance.\" In total, six survivors described independently to the BBC, in near identical detail, how coastguards caused their boat to capsize . Image caption, Survivors Ahmad and Musaab claimed the the coastguard had instructed them to keep quiet about other factors in the disaster Mobile phone evidence not examined No video from onboard the Adriana has ever emerged, let alone the moment of sinking. The coastguard said their own high-specification cameras were not recording. Some survivors said they at times had been filming while onboard but that coastguards confiscated their mobiles shortly after they were rescued. These phones were apparently then lost before being found almost a month later in a bag onboard the one coastguard vessel that had been present at the sinking. Defence lawyers had requested that some phones be examined for potentially useful evidence, but court documents obtained by the BBC show the investigating magistrate ruled last year that this would be a futile exercise as a “self-evident consequence” of the migrant falling into the sea was that their phones would have all been irreversibly damaged: “The sea water has entered the confiscated phones which resulted in the inability to extract any kind of stored digital data from them and as such [attempting to extract data] is pointless.” Greek military investigation ongoing The separate Naval Court investigation into the potential liability of the coastguard opened in the weeks after the disaster, but it remains at the preliminary stages. Human rights groups believe that this should be concluded before any criminal trial of the Egyptian defendants. Christos Dimopoulos, director of Amnesty International Greece said: “The criminal court will probably have incomplete information in assessing the culpability of the defendants. There is a real risk for the trial to be based on incomplete and/or questionable evidence.” The Greek government, which has vowed to hold smugglers to account and to crack down on illegal crossings, has said justice will be done. Judith Sunderland, associate Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch said: “Credible and meaningful accountability for one of the worst shipwrecks in the Mediterranean needs to include a determination of any liabilities of Greek authorities.” Related Topics Greece Europe migrant crisis More on this story New data casts doubt on Greek account of boat disaster Published 18 June 2023 \\'Instead of saving us they sank the boat\\' Published 30 June 2023 Up to 500 missing in migrant boat disaster - UN Published 16 June 2023'],\n",
       " 'Paula Vennells: Five questions for the ex-Post Office boss': ['Five questions for ex-Post Office boss Paula Vennells Image source, Alamy Emma Simpson Business correspondent @BBCEmmaSimpson Published 21 May 2024, 00:12 BST Updated 37 minutes ago The former boss of the Post Office, Paula Vennells, is giving evidence on Wednesday at the public inquiry into the Horizon IT scandal. It is a major investigation into how hundreds of sub-postmasters were wrongly prosecuted starting in 1999 after faulty software said money was missing from Post Office branch accounts. Ms Vennells was chief executive from 2012 to 2019. During this time, sub-postmasters were still being prosecuted but the Post Office continued to deny the faulty Horizon software was to blame, despite mounting evidence of wrongful convictions. This will be the first time Ms Vennells has spoken publicly about what happened in almost a decade. She will be grilled for three days. So, what are some of the key questions she has to answer? When did she know accounts could be accessed remotely? The Post Office always claimed sub-postmasters\\' branch accounts could not be remotely accessed without their knowledge. Prosecutions were done on the basis that the accounts were secure. Once it became known that Fujitsu, the company responsible for the Horizon system, was able to do this, it undermined every prosecution case and civil claim the Post Office had brought. We now know that the Post Office was made aware as early as 2010 about this secret “back door” access. We also know that in 2015, Paula Vennells wrote a memo to colleagues saying she needed to be able to say, “No, this isn’t possible.” At the time, she was preparing for an important appearance in front of MPs, as the pressure grew for the Post Office to come clean about the scale of the problems. So when exactly did she know the truth about remote access? Did she lie to Parliament in 2015? Paula Vennells went on to tell MPs on the business select committee in 2015 that she had seen no evidence of any miscarriages of justice. But two years earlier barrister Simon Clarke warned the Post Office there were problems with past prosecutions. He said this was because they’d relied on evidence from Gareth Jenkins, the Fujitsu IT engineer who failed to disclose to the courts that he knew about bugs in the system. Mr Clarke wrote that this left the Post Office in breach of its duty as prosecutor. Lord Arbuthnot, one of the leading campaigners for the sub-postmasters, says Ms Vennells must have known about the advice. “It does make you wonder what reassurances, if any, had she been given, and by whom, before she said what she said on public record.” Who is Paula Vennells? Ex-Post Office boss in Horizon IT inquiry Published 1 day ago Paula Vennells: A key moment for the Post Office Inquiry Why didn’t she do more to find out what was going on? When Ms Vennells, who was also a part-time Anglican priest, became chief executive, the business was haemorrhaging money. She was under pressure to modernise the business and make it profitable. Horizon was too big and important to fail. Nick Wallis, author of the Great Post Office Scandal, believes Ms Vennells didn’t want to be given bad information. “I think she relied on Post Office loyalists and highly paid legal advisers to tell her the truth she wanted to hear.” It\\'s clear there were plenty of missed opportunities along the way. In 2012, under pressure from sub-postmasters and MPs, forensic accountants Second Sight were appointed to look into the growing number of complaints. Second Sight played a key role in exposing the scandal, finding flaws in the Horizon computer system but Post Office bosses secretly decided in April 2014 to sack the firm, documents obtained by the BBC showed. Why did she allow the Post Office to fight sub-postmasters in court? Ms Vennells defended the Horizon system right to the end. After a mediation scheme to help victims collapsed, sub-postmasters launched an epic High Court battle to get to the truth. This was the fight for justice launched in 2017 by Alan Bates and a group of 555 sub-postmasters which inspired ITV drama Mr Bates vs The Post Office. Ms Vennells was in charge when the Post Office decided to defend the action, going on to spend £100m fighting the group in court despite knowing its defence was untrue , a draft report uncovered by the BBC showed. The Post Office said it would be \"inappropriate\" to comment on this report. “They doubled down, rather than accept the reality,” says Paul Marshall, a barrister who represented several wrongly convicted branch managers. Ms Vennells left the Post Office just before the damning judgement came through. Was anyone pulling her strings? There’s one key bit of context to all this. The Post Office is owned by the government, which has a representative on its board. There’s an awful lot we don’t know about what went on between ministers, top civil servants and the decision making during her leadership, a crucial phase when the alleged cover-up was in full swing. How much did she tell them about the faults and the problems? And what were they telling her? Did Fujitsu mislead her? Everyone touched by this terrible scandal now wants to hear the truth from Ms Vennells. In a statement from her solicitors she said: \"I am truly sorry for the devastation caused to the sub-postmasters and their families, whose lives were torn apart by being wrongly accused and wrongly prosecuted as a result of the Horizon system.\" She added: \"I now intend to continue to focus on assisting the inquiry and will not make any further public comment until it has concluded.\" Related Topics Post Office Inquiry Post Office Ltd More on this story Why were hundreds of Post Office workers wrongly prosecuted?

Financially stretched parents are less likely to give youngsters a weekly allowance than they were the previous year, according to NatWest Rooster Money. But children are supplementing their incomes, thanks to completing other work at home and for themselves. That takes overall weekly income up by 3p on a year earlier to £9.23, the report estimates. The findings are based on data drawn from more than 300,000 children aged between 6 and 17 who use the NatWest Rooster Money pocket money app and prepaid card. As such, it can only be an estimate, and will not include children who do not receive any money at all. It suggests that a shrinking proportion of families, with children using the app, now pay pocket money as part of a regular routine. In this data, about 30% pay regular pocket money, compared with 32% a year earlier, with youngsters most commonly receiving it on a Saturday. A greater proportion than that are paid for chores - about 40% - although this was also down from 47% a year earlier. Mowing the lawn, cleaning the car, cleaning the windows and gardening are the most lucrative, according to the report.

Mrs Justice Foster has lifted an order which had prevented journalists revealing the identity of 17-year-old Rayis Nibeel, who has been convicted of murdering 38-year-old Omar Khan in Luton. An order had been made under legislation aimed at protecting children and teenagers involved in court cases. But the judge has lifted the order after the BBC argued that revealing Nibeel’s name was in the public interest. Image source, Bedfordshire Police Image caption, Umer Choudhury, 18, was also convicted of murder Jurors had earlier this year found Nibeel and another teenager, 18-year-old Umer Choudhury, guilty of murdering Mr Khan, who was attacked with a 15in (37.5cm) hunting knife. They had heard how Mr Khan, of Leicester Road, Luton, had died at the scene of the attack in the Sundon Park area of Luton on 16 September 2023, after a row over drugs. Mrs Justice Foster jailed both teenagers on Friday during a sentencing hearing at St Albans Crown Court. She said Nibeel, of Butely Road, Luton, would serve a minimum of 20 years in custody and Choudhury, of Tulip Close, Luton, a minimum of 18 years. Image source, CPS Image caption, The model of knife used to kill Omar Khan, next to the sheath found at the scene. It was described as an \"interesting collector\\'s piece that isn\\'t afraid of heavy use\" by online retailer DNA Leisure Detectives said Nibeel had bought 79 bladed items, including the murder weapon, in the months leading up to the attack on Mr Khan. Police said he had used his mother\\'s ID to buy 39 hunting knives, 15 machetes and 12 swords, among other items, and get them delivered to his home. All were bought from an online retailer, linked to another murder in 2022.

Based on the outskirts of Luton, just six miles (10km) from the murder scene, it is run by one-time Junior Apprentice candidate Adam Eliaz, who insisted he had done nothing wrong. In a statement, DNA Leisure said it complied \"with all current UK legislation relating to the sales of bladed articles, including the laws relating to remote sales and age verification\". Image source, Facebook Image caption, Omar Khan, 38, was murdered in a drug deal gone wrong The judge heard Nibeel had been 16 and Choudhury 17, when Mr Khan was killed. Orders had earlier been made preventing journalists from naming either teenager. But a BBC journalist argued at Friday’s sentencing hearing that both orders should be lifted because the public had a right to know their names. Mrs Justice Foster ruled that Choudhury could be named because he was now 18 and an adult. Lawyers representing Choudhury had not objected to the order preserving his anonymity being lifted. Image source, Ben Schofield/BBC Image caption, Nibeel attacked Mr Khan near an alleyway in the Sundon Park area of Luton Lawyers representing Nibeel had objected to him being named.

The judge announced her decision on Monday – in a ruling posted on the Courts and Tribunals Judiciary website –  and concluded that Nibeel should be named.

       " 'Electricity grids creak as AI demands soar': ['Electricity grids creak as AI demands soar Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Data centre electricity needs are forecast to double between 2022 and 2026 Chris Baraniuk Technology reporter Published 8 hours ago There’s a big problem with generative AI, says Sasha Luccioni at Hugging Face, a machine-learning company. Generative AI is an energy hog. “Every time you query the model, the whole thing gets activated, so it’s wildly inefficient from a computational perspective,” she says. Take the Large Language Models (LLMs) at the heart of many Generative AI systems. They have been trained on vast stores of written information, which helps them to churn out text in response to practically any query. “When you use Generative AI… it’s generating content from scratch, it’s essentially making up answers,” Dr Luccioni explains. That means the computer has to work pretty hard. A Generative AI system might use around 33 times more energy than machines running task-specific software, according to a recent study , external by Dr Luccioni and colleagues. The work has been peer-reviewed but is yet to be published in a journal. It’s not your personal computer that uses all this energy, though. Or your smartphone. The computations we increasingly rely on happen in giant data centres that are, for most people, out of sight and out of mind. “The cloud,” says Dr Luccioni. “You don’t think about these huge boxes of metal that heat up and use so much energy.” The world’s data centres are using ever more electricity , external . In 2022, they gobbled up 460 terawatt hours of electricity, and the International Energy Agency (IEA) expects , external this to double in just four years. Data centres could be using a total of 1,000 terawatts hours annually by 2026. “This demand is roughly equivalent to the electricity consumption of Japan,” says the IEA. Japan has a population of 125 million people. At data centres, huge volumes of information are stored for retrieval anywhere in the world – everything from your emails to Hollywood movies. The computers in those faceless buildings also power AI and cryptocurrency. They underpin life as we know it. Image source, Tim Chin Image caption, AI can be \"wildly inefficient\" when using computing resources, says Sasha Luccioni But some countries know all too well how energy hungry these facilities are. There is currently a moratorium preventing the construction of new data centres , external in Dublin. Nearly a fifth of Ireland’s electricity is used up by data centres, and this figure is expected to grow significantly in the next few years – meanwhile Irish households are reducing their consumption , external . The boss of National Grid said in a speech in March that data centre electricity demand in the UK will rise six-fold in just 10 years , fuelled largely by the rise of AI. National Grid expects that the energy required for electrifying transport and heat will be much larger in total, however. Utilities firms in the US are beginning to feel the pressure, says Chris Seiple at Wood Mackenzie, a consultancy. “They’re getting hit with data centre demands at the exact same time as we have a renaissance taking place – thanks to government policy – in domestic manufacturing,” he explains. Lawmakers in some states are now rethinking tax breaks offered to data centre developers because of the sheer strain these facilities are putting on local energy infrastructure, according to reports in the US , external . Mr Seiple says there is a “land grab” going on for data centre locations near to power stations or renewable energy hubs: “Iowa is a hotbed of data centre development, there’s a lot of wind generation there.” Some data centres can afford to go to more remote locations these days because latency – the delay, usually measured in milliseconds, between sending information out from a data centre and the user receiving it – is not a major concern for increasingly popular Generative AI systems. In the past, data centres handling emergency communications or financial trading algorithms, for example, have been sited within or very near to large population centres, for the absolute best response times. Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Jensen Huang, Nvidia chief executive, shows off the new Blackwell chip in March There is little doubt that the energy demands of data centres will rise in the coming years, but there is huge uncertainty over how much, stresses Mr Seiple. Part of that uncertainty is down to the fact that the hardware behind generative AI is evolving all the time. Tony Grayson is general manager at Compass Quantum, a data-centre business, and he points to Nvidia’s recently launched Grace Blackwell supercomputer chips (named after a computer scientist and a mathematician), which are designed specifically to power high-end processes including generative AI, quantum computing and computer-aided drug design. Nvidia says that, in the future, a company could train AIs several times larger than the largest AI systems currently available in 90 days using 8,000 of the previous generation of Nvidia chips. This would need a 15 megawatt electricity supply. But the same work could be carried out , external in the same time by just 2,000 Grace Blackwell chips, and they would need a four megawatt supply, according to Nvidia. (That still ends up as 8.6 gigawatt hours of electricity consumed – more than the annual electricity demand of Northern Ireland.) “The performance is going up so much that your overall energy savings are big,” says Mr Grayson. But he agrees that power demands are shaping where data centre operators site their facilities: “People are going to where cheap power’s at.” Dr Luccioni notes that the energy and resources required to manufacture the latest computer chips are significant. More technology of business How quantum physics could \\'revolutionise everything\\' Published 7 May How the computer games industry is embracing AI Published 3 May Migrants hit by high fees to send money home Published 30 April Still, it is true that data centres have got more energy efficient over time, argues Dale Sartor, a consultant and affiliate of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in the US. Their efficiency is often measured in terms of power usage effectiveness, or PUE. The lower the number, the better. State-of-the-art data centres have a PUE of around 1.1, he notes. These facilities do still create significant amounts of waste heat and Europe is ahead of the US in finding ways of using that waste heat – such as warming up swimming pools – says Mr Sartor. Bruce Owen, UK managing director at Equinix, a data centre firm, says, “I still think that the demand is going to grow further than that efficiency gain that we see.” He predicts that more data centres will be built with on-site power-generating facilities included. Equinix was denied planning permission , external for a gas-powered data centre in Dublin last year. Mr Sartor adds that costs may ultimately determine whether Generative AI is worth it for certain applications: “If the old way is cheaper and easier then there’s not going to be much of a market for the new way.” Dr Luccioni stresses, though, that people will need to clearly understand how the options in front of them differ in terms of energy efficiency. She is working on a project to develop energy ratings for AI. “Instead of picking this GPT-derivative model that is very clunky and uses a lot of energy, you can pick this A+ energy star model that will be a lot more lightweight and efficient,” she says.

From the section Women\\'s Football It usually takes at least nine months for professional athletes to return to fitness after an ACL injury Australia striker Sam Kerr has officially been ruled out of the 2024 Paris Olympics, as she recovers from an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear. The 30-year-old was injured during a Chelsea training camp in January. Announcing a squad for Australia\\'s pre-Olympics friendlies, Matildas coach Tony Gustavsson said Kerr would not return in time for the Games in July. Kerr, arguably Australia\\'s biggest sporting idol, is the nation\\'s all-time record goalscorer. She is the latest in a long list of high-profile female footballers - including England captain Leah Williamson and Dutch striker Vivianne Miedema - to suffer an ACL injury. It usually takes at least nine months for professional athletes to return to fitness after surgery. Why are so many female footballers suffering ACL injuries? The Matildas have had a difficult run-up to the Olympics, with several key players sidelined by injury. Midfielder Katrina Gorry has been out after ankle surgery, defender Clare Hunt has battled a foot fracture, and stalwart Aivi Luik has a hamstring injury. Young midfielder Amy Sayer also tore her ACL last month and has been ruled out of the Olympics. Before the send-off matches against China, Gustavsson said selection for the 18-strong Olympics squad had become a complicated equation - with some hopefuls racing against time to return to the field. \"This window will be a tough one for me and my staff in terms of evaluating players, where they are, and then the final selection process for Paris,\" he said. Kerr was expected to be an integral part of the Matildas medal campaign in Paris, after the team just missed the podium at the previous Olympics in Tokyo and the World Cup in Australia last year. Since joining Chelsea in 2020, Kerr has won five successive Women\\'s Super League titles, three Women\\'s FA Cups, two Women\\'s League Cups and the Women\\'s Community Shield. She has scored 99 goals for the Blues and a further 64 for Australia, and has also been nominated for the Ballon d\\'Or Feminin - the top prize in women\\'s football - every year since its inception in 2018. But it has been a difficult 12 months for Kerr. She spent much of the home World Cup on the bench with a calf strain, and shortly after her ACL injury, was in January charged with racially aggravated harassment of a London police officer, to which she has pleaded not guilty.'],\n",

The prime minister said the government would pay \"whatever it costs\" following a damning report on the scandal , external , which saw 30,000 people infected. A public inquiry found authorities had exposed victims to unacceptable risks and covered up the NHS\\'s biggest treatment disaster. The government will set out compensation details on Tuesday. Ministers have reportedly earmarked around £10bn for a compensation package. The Infected Blood Inquiry accused doctors, government and the NHS of letting patients catch HIV and hepatitis while they were receiving NHS care between the 1970s and 1990s. About 3,000 have since died and more deaths will follow. Chris Mason: Will things ever change? Infected blood report\\'s key findings at a glance Why thousands of NHS patients were given infected blood Read more about the victims, families and what happened Mr Sunak described the release of the report as a \"day of shame for the British state\" and vowed to pay \"comprehensive compensation\" to those affected and infected by the scandal. \"Whatever it costs to deliver this scheme, we will pay it,\" he told the House of Commons on Monday. He said Cabinet Office minister John Glen would set out the details of compensation on Tuesday. Members of the infected blood community said that they expected the government to set out how much compensation would be paid, simplified into a few categories. This is likely to come under five main categories: injury, social impact, autonomy, care and financial loss. Sir Keir Starmer, leader of the opposition Labour party, apologised too for his party\\'s involvement whilst in government and welcomed the Conservative prime minister\\'s confirmation of financial support for victims, saying Labour would \"work with him to get that done swiftly\". \\'Compensation must be paid now\\' The inquiry looked at over 50 years of decision-making before, during and after the infection of thousands of people from contaminated blood transfusions and blood products from the 1970s onwards. The 2,527-page report found the infected blood scandal \"could largely have been avoided\" and there had been a cover-up to hide the truth. Deliberate attempts were made to conceal the disaster, including evidence of Whitehall officials destroying documents, the inquiry found. Inquiry chairman Sir Brian Langstaff said: \"What I have found is that disaster was no accident. \"People put their trust in doctors and the government to keep them safe and that trust was betrayed... \"That\\'s why what I\\'m recommending is that compensation must be paid now.\" Image source, PA Media Image caption, Families gathered in Central Hall in London for the publication of the inquiry\\'s report Sir Brian\\'s two interim reports, in July 2022 and April 2023, made recommendations about compensation for victims and their families.

It is the first of two Australian aircraft arriving to rescue 300 citizens who have registered for assistance in the French Pacific territory. A New Zealand Air Force plane has also arrived, according to Flightradar24, and is among a series of proposed flights which will bring about 50 people home. The unrest began last week after lawmakers in Paris voted through changes that will allow more French residents to vote in local elections, a move indigenous leaders say will dilute the political influence of native people. Four civilians - including at least three indigenous Kanak residents - have been killed in riots along with two police officers. Dozens more have been injured and more than 200 people arrested so far. Both Australia and New Zealand said they would prioritise flying out those with the most \"pressing need\", with passenger lists being organised by consular staff. Tourists from other countries would also be assisted, Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said. France\\'s High Commission in New Caledonia said on Tuesday the airport remained closed for commercial flights, and it would deploy the military to protect public buildings. As well as witnessing fires and looting, holidaymakers who have been stuck for more than a week have reported food shortages. \"The situation in New Caledonia remains dynamic, and New Zealand officials are continuing to work with French counterparts and other partners especially Australia to understand what is needed to ensure the safety of our people there,\" New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters said. Around 290 New Zealanders are believed to be in New Caledonia. Australian tourist Maxwell Winchester told AFP news agency that he and and his wife Tiffany were \"ecstatic\" at the prospect of getting home after being confined to a resort near Nouméa for over a week. \"We realise we probably won\\'t get on these flights, because those who have higher needs will get on them, but we at least know we have a way out in the next few days,\" he said. The French High Commission in New Caledonia say French gendarmes trying to take back control of the 60km (37 mile) road between Nouméa and La Tontouta international have \"neutralised\" 76 roadblocks and are now clearing debris such as burnt-out vehicles. Image source, Reuters AFP journalists said the roadblocks had been rebuilt by pro-independence Kanak activists. A masked 25-year-old who gave only his first name Stanley, said the proposed voting reform \"means the elimination of the Kanak people\". \"That\\'s what they don\\'t understand over there - we are already in the minority in our own home,\" he told AFP. Another masked man named Simon, 34 said they were letting drivers pass through the roadblock. \"It\\'s calm, the regulars already know us on the barricades,\" he said. Travel advice by the Australian government has warned people not to try and get to the airport themselves saying the route “is not yet considered safe”. The airport remains closed for commercial flights, and a decision on when to reopen it will be reassessed on Thursday, the local government has said. It has estimated that about 3,200 people are waiting to leave or enter New Caledonia. France has flown in 1,050 extra police to boost security in the territory, with a further 600 reinforcements to arrive \"in the coming hours\", France\\'s High Commission in New Caledonia said on Tuesday. The military is being deployed to protect public buildings, it added. Earlier this week, French President Emmanuel Macron warned that the military would need to remain deployed in New Caledonia \"for some time\". Viro Xulue, part of a Kanak community group providing social assistance, told Reuters it felt like a return to the unrest of the 1980s. \"We are really scared about the police, the French soldiers, and we are scared about the anti-Kanak militia terrorist group. \"The French Government doesn\\'t know how to control people here.

Mr Wyden also urged the US Customs and Border Protection agency to \"supercharge enforcement and crack down on companies that fuel the shameful use of forced labour in China\". The report added Jaguar Land Rover had imported spare parts which included components from JWD after the company was put on the banned list.

The legislation is intended to prevent the import of goods from China\\'s north-western Xinjiang region that are believed to have been made by people from the Uyghur minority group in forced labour conditions. JWD was added to the UFLPA Entity List in December 2023, which means its products are presumed to be made with forced labour. China has been accused of detaining more than one million Uyghurs in Xinjiang against their will over the past few years. Authorities have denied all allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang. “The so-called Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act by the US is not about forced labor but about creating unemployment. It does not protect human rights but, under the guise of human rights, harms the survival and employment rights of the people in Xinjiang,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said. \"China strongly condemns and firmly opposes this.

A single commercial flight left the capital on Monday and later landed in Miami, Florida. More flights are expected this week. Haiti\\'s transitional authorities hope that more much needed basic supplies - such as medicine - will now start arriving, and trapped foreigners will be able to leave the impoverished country. But gangs still control much of the capital, and Haiti\\'s main seaport remains closed. How gangs came to dominate Haiti Published 4 March Monday\\'s flight was organised by Haiti\\'s Sunrise Airways company, who contracted Florida-based World Atlantic charter carrier. The departure was reportedly delayed for nearly two hours, with passengers complaining about stuffy conditions on board the aircraft. Nevertheless, local residents said they were happy to be able to travel again. \"There are thousands of people who wanted to travel, but for a certain time who could not travel. I have my tent which I had to live in for more than three months. Many people were suffering,\" Rosemond Desire told AP Television News. Until Monday, the only operating airport was in the northern city of Cap-Haïtien. But many Haitians have been unable to get there because of continuing gang violence in and around the capital. US airlines are not expected to resume their flights to Port-au-Prince until late May or early June.

Hursey came through the European singles qualification tournament in Sarajevo to become the first British player to secure a place in Paris. The 17-year-old secured one of the five available Olympic spots after a string of victories against players ranked higher than her own current world number 98 rating. “I've no idea what the Olympics is going to be like,” Hursey told BBC Sport Wales. “I think that it might be a little bit similar to the Commonwealth Games but maybe like times ten. “So I'm really excited for that and just to kind of experience every little thing, also to kind of remember it and just have the experience in an Olympics for hopefully many more Olympic Games. “I've always wanted to go to the Olympics.

Tom and Emily Ford, of Holmes Chapel, Cheshire, are preparing for the Games in July . They are taking part in their second Olympics having featured in the Tokyo 2020 Games, which was delayed due to the Covid pandemic, where Tom, 31, won bronze. The siblings are delighted this time round that their loved ones will be there to support them which they said would be a \"big boost\". Rowing was a huge part of their childhood after watching their older twin brothers win the National Championships and National School Regattas together. While the twins no longer row, Emily, 29, and Tom both row for Great Britain. Since his Olympic bronze, Tom has stroked the men’s eight to back to back World Championship titles. Meanwhile, Emily and her teammate Esme Booth have made history by becoming the first British women to qualify two boats for an Olympic Games at the same regatta.

Dorset Police\\'s charge rate for rape and serious sexual offences went from 23.7% in 2014-15 to 4.9% in 2022-23. The family of Gaia Pope - whose death prompted an inquest that heard she believed her own allegation of rape was not taken seriously - called the latest figures \"an absolute scandal\". The force said its charge rate had been improving over the last year and it remained committed to bringing offenders to justice. Data analysed by the BBC about rape and serious sexual offences found the force\\'s charge rate - which includes charges, summons and postal requisitions - had been below the national average for most of the past nine years. Dorset Police\\'s charge rate for such offences dropped steadily from 2015-16, then rose in 2020-21, and fell again to 4.9% by the end of March 2023. Data for the 2023-24 financial year is not yet publicly available. But Dorset Police told the BBC that in the last year its \"positive outcomes\" related to serious sexual offences had risen to 7.9%. \\'Profound shame\\' Miss Pope\\'s family said the figures should \"trigger some real self-examination\" by the force. The 19-year-old\\'s body was found in undergrowth near clifftops, 11 days after disappearing from her home in Swanage, Dorset, in November 2017. Miss Pope had reported being raped when she was 16 - an allegation that did not lead to a prosecution - by a man who was later convicted of sexual offences against other women. Image source, family Image caption, From left: Gaia\\'s twin Maya, her aunt Talia, mother Natasha, sister Clara and Marienna at the inquest into her death Miss Pope’s family has been calling for Dorset Police - and every force – to have a special rape and serious sexual offences (Rasso) unit , staffed by trained officers. Miss Pope’s cousin Marienna Pope-Weidemann said the decline in action rate was \"tantamount to the decriminalisation of abuse”. \"These figures should be a source of profound shame,\" she said. \"Investing in a Rasso unit is one way for Dorset Police to demonstrate that they are finally making this a priority and investing the resources that they need to pull their socks up.\" Image source, family Image caption, Gaia held Ms Pope-Weidemann\\'s hand during police interviews when she reported she had been raped Ms Pope-Weidemann accompanied Gaia to Dorset Police for two in-person rape evidence interviews. She described the interviews as \"enormously re-traumatising\" and said her cousin\\'s testimony was the \"bravest and most heartbreaking thing\" she had ever seen. \"She shook and held my hand right the way through,\" Ms Pope-Weidemann said. She added: \"She was so determined to give the police whatever they needed to investigate properly, because she wanted to protect other young girls from having to go through what she had gone through.\" Months later, when Gaia was told the force was dropping her rape case, Ms Pope-Weidemann said the teenager was \"devastated\". Dorset-based social action photographer Jayne Jackson said she believed the force\\'s \"poor\" record on sex offences could deter victims and survivors reporting  crimes for fear their perpetrators would not be pursued. \"We are not going to tolerate below average statistics or decreasing statistics. We want real action,\" she said. Image source, @Foxstrutuk Image caption, Jayne Jackson co-founded Fox Strut which aims to empower people against gender-based violence Dorset Police said the higher percentage in previous years should be “set against very much higher levels of reporting” lately, which it hoped showed an “increased confidence” in police among victims. It said it had “invested significantly” in specialist Rasso training and its detectives were required to “remain flexible” to meet demands and investigate “all serious crimes\". In recent years, Dorset Police undertook an assessment of its rape investigation processes and performances. The data from the assessment has led to the creation of a new operating model, which teams began implementing last July, the force said. Image caption, A tree is planted in memory of Gaia Pope in Prince Albert Gardens, Swanage Dorset Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC), David Sidwick, said he raised the case of an individual rape unit with the chief constable and the situation was being kept \"under constant review\". He pointed out that an individual rape unit was in operation in Dorset between 2013 and 2019, when charge rate declined. Mr Sidwick said evidence suggested forces had specialist trained officers instead. \"Dorset were asked to do this with 23 officers – in fact,  the force, because of the importance of this area, have trained 169,\" he said. He added: \"Since this has been done, we have seen an improvement in our Rasso performance and I am committed to continuing this good work.” Gaia\\'s family said it would continue to petition and campaign for change and said \"sustained public pressure\" was crucial to improvements being made.

Laurence Maguire told BBC NI’s Spotlight programme he had been called to answer questions about Wright for a UVF inquiry in the 1990s. Maguire said he had begun to have suspicions when Wright stopped him from killing three suspected Irish Republican Army (IRA) members, who were later killed by the republican group - accused of being state agents. The revelation comes after the government asked the Supreme Court to rule on whether to keep some intelligence on UVF murders a secret. Image caption, Laurence Maguire speaking to BBC Northern Ireland’s Spotlight programme The loyalist paramilitary group has been linked to multiple killings. Parts of Laurence Maguire’s interview were first broadcast in 2019, but further details of what he told Spotlight have become more relevant because of information which emerged at recently stalled inquests. Maguire, who was jailed in 1994 for five murders, told Spotlight that Wright had asked him to track three men believed to be in the IRA. He described following them weekly, and his plan to shoot them in a rural park outside Dungannon. But, he said, whenever he proposed the attack, Billy Wright “was putting it back”. “I thought there was something strange about it, and when I look back now, it seems there was a lot of strange things about it,” Maguire said. Image source, Pacemaker Image caption, L-R Aidan Starrs, John Dignam and Gregory Burns were abducted and killed by the IRA Shortly afterwards, in July 1992, the three men – Gregory Burns, Aidan Starrs and John Dignam – were abducted and killed by the IRA. The IRA said all three men were informers, and had been involved in the murder of Portadown woman Margaret Perry because she had learned that Burns was working for the intelligence services. Former IRA member Tommy McKearney, whose brother and uncle were killed by Wright’s gang, said Maguire’s story raised the question of whether Wright had been protecting the IRA men because they were informants. If Wright “was an agent”, he asked, “was he acting on orders to prevent Laurence Maguire operating against them?” Maguire said he had subsequently been questioned by the UVF as part of an investigation into “suspicions” about Wright. “I think it came to light that he was definitely working for somebody else. “I just call it the Crown,\" he said. Image caption, Bernie McKearney\\'s husband and parents were killed in 1992 An inquest into UVF murders in Mid Ulster heard earlier this year that the late Progressive Unionist Party leader, David Ervine, had headed just such an inquiry into Billy Wright. The court heard the investigation had collapsed when another senior UVF figure, and suspected police informer, Robin Jackson, did not show up to testify against Wright. Jackson, who has since died, was also named in court documents as being suspected of involvement in a number of attacks in Mid Ulster. Bernie McKearney’s husband and parents were killed in attacks carried out by Mid Ulster UVF in 1992. Inquests into the deaths of Kevin and John McKearney, and Charles and Teresa Fox, stalled earlier this year when the secretary of state took legal action to prevent some material from being released. “I do get emotional at times and I hate it, because I try to be a strong person,” Bernie McKearney said. “But it has been hard knowing that if Kevin had have got the protection that state agents got, he could be living today.\" Image source, Pacemaker Image caption, Kevin and John McKearney were attacked in the family butcher shop in Moy Other former UVF figures have also accused Wright of being an agent. Former Police Ombudsman Baroness Nuala O’Loan said, “I think we know that Billy Wright was an informant.\" She is critical of the government’s legal action, describing it as “absolutely appalling”. “There is no justification whatsoever for denying them information which may have been of some significance to national security 30 years ago or years ago, but which now cannot, in many cases, be of any significance whatsoever.” Wright broke away from the UVF in 1996 to form the Loyalist Volunteer Force and was killed in the Maze Prison the following year. All Troubles-era cases are now being referred to a new body known as the Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR). The Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), Jon Boutcher, has said he is prepared to give material to new investigators “without condition and without redaction”. Image source, PA Image caption, The Chief Constable Jon Boutcher said he is prepared to give police material to new investigators The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Northern Ireland Office, Lord Caine, encouraged families to work with the ICRIR , external . “This is now before the courts and we have to await the court’s judgement,\" he said. “What I would do, is encourage families who have lost loved ones, or whose loved ones are seriously injured, to work with the new body under the distinguished leadership of Sir Declan Morgan.” In April it emerged Laurence Maguire would be prosecuted for conspiracy to murder and possession of firearms, following admissions he made to the Spotlight Programme broadcast in 2019.

A team from Bournemouth University said bones found in Winterborne Kingston, Dorset, in 2010 revealed the woman in her late 20s was stabbed in the neck. Her spine also showed evidence of hard labour, her ribs were broken and isotopes in her teeth suggested she grew up more than 20 miles away.

Oonagh Cousins was offered a free place on a course run by the Lightning Process, which teaches people they can rewire their brains to stop or improve long Covid symptoms quickly. Ms Cousins, who contracted Covid in March 2020, said it \"exploits\" people. However, the programme\\'s founder denied it blames patients for their illness, saying that was completely at odds with the concepts of the programme Physical illness Ms Cousins had reached a career goal many athletes can only dream of - being selected for the Olympics - when she developed long Covid. By the time the cancelled 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo were rescheduled for 2021, Ms Cousins was too ill to take part. When she went public with her struggles, she was approached by the Lightning Process. It offered her a free place on a three-day course, which usually costs around £1,000. \"They were trying to suggest that I could think my way out of the symptoms, basically. And I disputed that entirely,\" the former rower said. \"I had a very clearly physical illness. And I felt that they were blaming my negative thought processes for why I was ill.\" She added: \"They tried to point out that I had depression or anxiety. And I said \\'I\\'m not, I\\'m just very sick\\'.\" What are the symptoms of long Covid? Long Covid blood clues could prompt future trials Health staff start court fight over long Covid There is no official test or approved treatment for long Covid - an umbrella term to describe a range of different problems in different people. For illnesses we cannot yet directly test for, there is a history of branding them as being driven by mindset. This is an ongoing challenge for ME patients, also known as chronic fatigue syndrome. Multiple sclerosis and extreme pregnancy sickness were both, at one time, considered to be psychological. But researchers now have growing evidence of what is causing long Covid - pockets of virus hiding in organs, signs in the blood of a disrupted immune system, and other measurable changes. In secret recordings by the BBC, coaches can be heard telling patients that almost anyone can recover from long Covid by changing their thoughts, language and actions. Over three days on Zoom, the course taught the ritual that forms the basis of the programme. Every time you experience a symptom or negative thought, you say the word \"stop\", make a choice to avoid these symptoms and then do a positive visualisation of a time you felt well. You do this while walking around a piece of paper printed with symbols - a ritual the BBC was told to do as many as 50 times a day. Prof Danny Altmann, a leading long Covid researcher, says such behavioural approaches disregard the \"mass\" of underlying damage in patients that can be measured in tests. Image source, British Rowing Image caption, The 2020 Olympics in Tokyo were rescheduled for 2021, by which time Ms Cousins was too ill to take part We\\'ve spoken to several people who did not get better - and even felt worse - after taking the course. There were some who said it did help them a lot, including one who said it made her feel better almost immediately. In some cases the Lightning Process has encouraged participants to increase their activity levels without medical supervision, against official advice - which could make some more unwell, according to NHS guidelines. Lightning Process founder, Dr Phil Parker, who\\'s not a medical doctor but has a PhD in psychology of health, told us his course was \"not a mindset or positive thinking approach,\" but one that uses \"the brain to influence physiological changes\", backed by peer-reviewed evidence. The coach on the course we attended said \"thoughts about your symptoms, your worry about whether it\\'s ever going to go - that\\'s what keeps the neurology going.\" \"Being in those kind of thoughts is what\\'s maintaining your symptoms,\" the coach said. \"They\\'re not caused by a physical thing any more.\" Postcode lottery Dr Camilla Nord, a neuroscientist at the University of Cambridge, disputed these claims. She said the Lightning Process was \"right that the brain can create symptoms of physical ill health\" but added: \"I think it\\'s a wild claim to say there\\'s nothing wrong with your body.\" She believes there is a place for therapies that calm the body\\'s stress response and adjust how people react to their symptoms. But even if some symptoms are based in the brain, she added, that didn\\'t mean it was \"something that you can actively change\". The coach on the course stressed the importance of avoiding negative thoughts and words like \"pain\" and \"fatigue\", claiming using them can continue symptoms. \"I\\'m afraid now we\\'ve strayed very, very far from neuroscience,\" Dr Nord says, calling this an \"abuse\" of scientific terms. When we put these specific claims to Dr Parker, he said our questions seemed to be \"informed solely by the rumours and misinformation\" circulated by what he called \"anti-recovery activists\". Long Covid support groups told the BBC\\'s File on 4 programme that a lack of consistent services for patients is leaving people with nowhere to go. Of the 90 trusts running long Covid services in England, about two-thirds (58 trusts) responded to Freedom of Information requests asking for details about their provision. Of those, seven had at least one full-time doctor on staff. Eleven said they could not order tests or scans, while 24 said they could not prescribe drugs. Prof Altmann, said: \"There are hundreds of thousands of dissatisfied, desperate patients who never get to meet any doctor.\" He said the long Covid clinic coverage was \"uneven\" and had become a \"postcode lottery\".

Councillor Nikki Wingfield said: \"We would love to have people help us raise the money. We will be launching some kind of crowd funder very shortly. \"We\\'d be really pleased if people could write in or leave comments to say that they use the park and how important it is.\" Image source, Federica Bedendo/BBC Image caption, The toilet block is more than 100 years old She added the play park needed a full refurbishment to improve accessibility. \"In the summer and on weekends, it\\'s packed with children,\" she said. \"The last time it had a full refurbishment was back in 2001, but if you have a look around, things are starting to look a little old and a bit tired and it\\'s not very accessible, so it\\'s not really suitable for all children to come and play.\" People can submit their letters of support to the parish council via its website , external .

Tewkesbury Borough Council will be concentrating its efforts from now until 2030 on tackling the issue, to help those directly affected as well as the wider community. Council leaders said they will prioritise social rented homes and other ways of meeting residents\\' needs, as well as finding options to reduce the use of hotels and bed and breakfasts for temporary accommodation. “If someone is rough sleeping, that is not a lifestyle choice,\" councillor Richard Stanley said. “It’s on us as an authority to do all that we can\", he added. He was responding to comments by Conservative councillor Paul McLain in a council debate on 15 May, when he said rough sleeping would \"never\" be eradicated. Civic chiefs will work to ensure rough sleeping in the borough is rare, brief and non-recurrent, by reacting quickly to people\\'s whilst increasing the supply of appropriate affordable housing, the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS) said. The pledge includes finishing action plans for every property in the borough which has been empty for more than two years. The council will also work to ensure properties are safe and free from significant health risks, like damp and mould. It will also explore possible development sites for affordable housing in rural areas. Mr McLain said the council needs to be realistic when tackling homelessness. He also said people have the “absolute right” to choose to be rough sleepers. “Rough sleeping, we will never eradicate it,” he said. “We are right to put all our powers into it but we will never eradicate it because we have to accept that for some, it is their absolute right, their choice to remain rough sleepers.\" Follow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook , external , X , external and Instagram , external .

Legal and General admit the £132m project has suffered delays after Henry construction went into administration last June. The development will see more than 500 new apartments built along a linear park and will include the medieval town walls. Legal and General said it was hoping to welcome the first residents in early 2026. The proposal was originally given the go-ahead by city councillors in January 2017. Councillor Sarah Bogle, cabinet member for economic development, said: “This is much needed residential capacity but what is so unique about these plans is the opening up of the North Walls which were hidden behind the old Bargate Centre.” Image caption, Developers hope work on the Bargate Quarter site can restart this summer The Bargate Quarter is one of several developments in the city which have stalled in recent years. Work has yet to begin on the Maritime Gateway project opposite the city’s central station – the former Toys R Us site. The city council recently approved an extension and alteration to the lease for Packaged Living to try and encourage them to start site clearance. Meanwhile demolition has started at the Leisure World site on West Quay Road. The owner of the land, Associated British Ports (ABP), said it had stepped in and was “working alongside others on extensive long-term plans for the site” but in the meantime it would be used to support the cruise industry, as parking. Outline planning for the site expired in July 2022. Image caption, Councillor Sarah Bogle said she felt \"optimistic\" It comes as the city council has appointed a planning and economics consultancy, Prior and Partners, to help create a Southampton Renaissance Masterplan, in response to the challenges the city is facing as part of the unsettled economic climate. Ms Bogle said: “Very simply, this is going to set out our vision for the city centre area and make sure developers work to that vision. We want to drive growth and prosperity, and it’s not just about buildings, it’s about connectivity, transport, improving lives, creating jobs.\" According to the city council, some £200m in major developments are in or approaching planning, and over £500m of investment has been consented and is moving forward across the city centre. Ms Bogle added: \"We’ve been through some tough economic times but I now feel really optimistic and we have lots of interests in the sites we have, plus great partners we are working with like the universities, port and football club.” Follow BBC South on Facebook , external , X (Twitter) , external , or Instagram , external .

Haemophilic David Thomas, from Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, contracted hepatitis C after being given contaminated blood aged 10. One of 400 people affected from Wales, he only found out in 1993 - some 13 years later.

In 2022, an independent report by Sir Robert Francis recommended compensation for victims irrespective of the findings of public inquiry. The UK government said at the time that it accepted the moral case for compensation and it made payments of £100,000 to 4,000 people who had been infected.

Paul Summers died at the age of 44 having contracted HIV after being given contaminated blood in his teens. “As far as parents and siblings are concerned, it’s never occurred to us that degree of compensation would be considered,\" said Mr Summers. \"My main concern is that they tell us where the fault lay, who caused the problems and that this can never happen again. “As far as compensation goes, that can’t bring Paul back.\" The Welsh government’s Health Minister Eluned Morgan said it would work with the UK government to ensure Welsh beneficiaries and their families are recompensed in keeping with the inquiry’s interim report on compensation.

       " \"Beaufort Park retirement village's expansion plans refused again\": [\"Retirement village expansion plans refused again Image source, Somerset Council Image caption, Neighbours said the expansion plans were 'overbearing' Daniel Mumby Local Democracy reporter Published 4 hours ago Plans to extend a retirement village have been refused for a second time. The company behind Beaufort Park in Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset, had applied to build 11 extra apartments at its site on Rectory Road. Beaufort Park Ltd, part of care provider Agincare, argued the town needs more accommodation for elderly people living independently. But a neighbour said the proposals would “destroy the peace and quiet” of the area. Beaufort Park was a former girls school and is comprised of ensuite rooms in the main building and a number of self-contained flats in its grounds. A bid to expand the site was first rejected by Somerset Council’s planning committee north, the body handling major applications in the former Sedgemoor area, in July 2023. Resubmitted plans featured an L-shaped development on the southern and eastern boundaries of the site and involved the demolition of a number of existing buildings. The proposals also included additional car parking and the creation of a new “sunken garden” for residents, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service . 'Totally inadequate' Jennifer Turco, who lives on Rectory Road, said the updated plans were “significantly worse than the first”. She told a committee meeting that noise from additional vehicles parking would “destroy the peace and quiet connected with Rectory Road’s sought-after character”. Graham King, who lives on Gardenhurst to the north of the site, said proposals for extra parking were “totally inadequate”. It said the development would cause “loss of privacy and disturbance” if given the go-ahead. Image source, Google Image caption, Beaufort Park was previously a girls' school Gill Slocombe, councillor for Bridgwater West, said she would feel uncomfortable living so close to such a large development. “I have to say the close proximity of this big building to me does seem quite overbearing – it seems like quite an enormous building to go into this area.” Councillor Tony Grimes, whose Brent division borders the site, said: “It’s huge - the shadowing will result in loss of light, and it’s out of character with the surrounding buildings. It’s just in the wrong place.” Mike Murphy, councillor for Burnham on Sea North, said that the resubmitted plans had a “much bigger footprint” than the originals. He described them as “overbearing” and “unneighbourly”. The committee voted unanimously to refuse permission at a meeting on 14 May.

Weekly capping means commuters are guaranteed the cheapest walk-up fare across a seven-day period, according to GTR. Customers using the pay-as-you-go keyGo service between Brighton and London Victoria could save almost £125 every week after making four journeys and being capped on the third day of travel, the rail company said. Mark Pavlides, chief customer officer at GTR, said: “With keyGo fares – applicable on our Key Smartcard – no matter how frequently you travel between the same two stations each week, you’ll never pay more than a weekly season ticket.” Customers will only be charged up to the value of the best value weekly season ticket for their selected route, and will be notified when their journeys reach the cap. Travellers who reach the weekly cap will also qualify for free additional journeys. Mr Pavlides said: \"The additional promise to never charge more than a weekly season ticket for travel between the same two stations means thousands of commuters returning to the office will never miss out on weekly season ticket deals, saving hundreds of pounds a week or month.\" Customers already using keyGo - approximately 30,000 according to the GTR database - immediately qualify for these savings, and GTR hopes to encourage thousands more people to sign up to benefit from weekly capping.

       " 'Gaza detainees shackled, blindfolded and in nappies at Israel hospital': ['Gazans ‘shackled and blindfolded’ at Israel hospital Image caption, Sufian Abu Salah said he was severely beaten while in Israeli detention and was denied treatment for a minor wound on his foot Lucy Williamson & Eye Investigations BBC News Published 4 hours ago Medical workers in Israel have told the BBC that Palestinian detainees from Gaza are routinely kept shackled to hospital beds, blindfolded, sometimes naked, and forced to wear nappies – a practice one medic said amounted to “torture”. A whistle-blower detailed how procedures in one military hospital were “routinely” carried out without painkillers, causing “an unacceptable amount of pain” to detainees. Another whistle-blower said painkillers were used “selectively” and “in a very limited way” during an invasive medical procedure on a Gazan detainee in a public hospital. He also said critically ill patients being held in makeshift military facilities were being denied proper treatment because of a reluctance by public hospitals to transfer and treat them. One detainee, taken from Gaza for questioning by the Israeli army and later released, told the BBC his leg had to be amputated because he was denied treatment for an infected wound. A senior doctor working inside the military hospital at the centre of the allegations denied that any amputations were the direct result of conditions there, but described the shackles and other restraints used by guards as “dehumanisation”. The Israeli army said detainees at the facility were treated “appropriately and carefully”. The two whistle-blowers the BBC spoke to were both in positions to assess the medical treatment of detainees.  Both asked to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the issue among their colleagues. Their accounts are supported by a report , external , published in February by Physicians for Human Rights in Israel, which said that Israel’s civilian and military prisons had become “an apparatus of retribution and revenge” and that detainees’ human rights were being violated - in particular their right to health. Image caption, The whistle-blowers said that Palestinian detainees had been routinely kept shackled to hospital beds and been forced to wear nappies Concerns over the treatment of sick and injured detainees have centred on a military field hospital, at the Sde Teiman military base in southern Israel. The field hospital was set up by Israel’s Health Ministry after the Hamas attacks specifically to treat Gazan detainees, after some public hospitals and staff expressed a reluctance to treat fighters captured on the day of the Hamas attacks. Since then, Israeli forces have rounded up large numbers of people from Gaza and taken them to bases like Sde Teiman for interrogation. Those suspected of fighting for Hamas are sent to Israeli detention centres; many others are released back to Gaza without charge. The army does not publish details of the detainees it is holding. Handcuffed and blindfolded Patients at the Sde Teiman hospital are kept blindfolded and permanently shackled to their beds by all four limbs, according to several medics responsible for treating patients there. They are also made to wear nappies, rather than use a toilet. Israel’s army said in response that handcuffing of detainees in the Sde Teiman hospital was “examined individually and daily, and carried out in cases where the security risk requires it”. It said that nappies [diapers] were used “only for detainees who have undergone medical procedures for which their movement is limited”. But witnesses, including the facility’s senior anaesthiologist, Yoel Donchin, say both the use of nappies and handcuffs are universal in the hospital ward. “The army create the patient to be 100% dependent, like a baby,” he said. “You are cuffed, you are with diapers, you need water, you need everything – it’s dehumanisation”. Dr Donchin said there was no individual assessment of the need for restraints, and that even those patients who were unable to walk – for example, those with leg amputations – were handcuffed to the bed.  He described the practice as “stupid”. Two witnesses at the facility in the early weeks of the Gaza war told us that patients there were kept naked under the blankets. One doctor with knowledge of conditions there said prolonged cuffing to beds would cause “huge suffering, horrible suffering”, describing it as “torture” and saying patients would start to feel pain after a few hours. Others have spoken of the risk of long-term nerve-damage. Image caption, Yoel Donchin, a senior anesthesiologist, says even those unable to walk were handcuffed to their beds Footage of Gazan detainees released after interrogation shows injuries and scarring around their wrists and legs. Last month, Israel’s daily Haaretz newspaper published allegations made by a doctor at the Sde Teiman site that leg amputations had been carried out on two prisoners, because of cuffing injuries. The allegations were made, the paper said, in a private letter sent by the doctor to government ministers and the attorney-general, in which such amputations were described as “unfortunately a routine event”. The BBC has not been able to independently verify this allegation. Dr Donchin said that amputations were not the direct result of cuffing and had involved other factors – such as infection, diabetes or problems with blood vessels. Israeli medical guidelines stipulate that no patient should be restrained unless there is a specific security reason for doing so, and that the minimum level of restraint should be used. The head of the country’s Medical Ethics Board, Yossi Walfisch, after a visit to the site, said all patients had a right to be treated without being handcuffed, but that the safety of staff prevailed over other ethical considerations. “Terrorists are given proper medical treatment,” he said in a published letter, “with the aim of keeping restraints to a minimum and while maintaining the safety of the treating staff.” Many Gazans detained by Israel’s army are released without charge after interrogation. Dr Donchin said complaints from medical staff at the Sde Teiman military hospital had led to changes, including a shift to looser handcuffs.  He said he insisted on guards removing restraints before any surgical procedure. “It’s not pleasant to work there,” he said. “I know it’s against the ethical code to treat someone cuffed in the bed.  But what’s the alternative? Is it better to let them die? I don’t think so.” But reports suggest the attitudes of medical staff towards detainees vary widely, in both military and civilian hospitals. \\'Unacceptable levels of pain\\' A whistle-blower who worked at the Sde Teiman field hospital back in October, shortly after the Hamas attacks on Israel, described cases of patients being given inadequate amounts of painkillers, including anaesthetic. He said a doctor once refused his request that an elderly patient be given painkillers while they were opening up a recent, infected amputation wound. “[The patient] started trembling from pain, and so I stop and say ‘we can’t go on, you need to give him analgesia’,” he said. The doctor told him it was too late to administer it. The witness said such procedures were “routinely done without analgesia” resulting in “an unacceptable amount of pain”. On another occasion, he was asked by a suspected Hamas fighter to intercede with the surgical team to increase the levels of morphine and anaesthetic during repeated surgeries. The message was passed on, but the suspect again regained consciousness during the next operation and was in a lot of pain. The witness said both he and other colleagues felt there was a sense in which it had been a deliberate act of revenge. The army said in response to these allegations that violence against detainees was “absolutely prohibited”, and that it regularly briefed its forces on the conduct required of them.  Any concrete details of violence or humiliation would be examined, it said. A second whistle-blower said the situation at Sde Teiman was only part of the problem, which extended into public hospitals. The BBC is calling him “Yoni” to protect his identity. In the days that followed the 7 October attacks, he said, hospitals in southern Israel were faced with the challenge of treating both wounded fighters and wounded victims, often in the same emergency departments. Hamas gunmen had just attacked Israeli communities along the border fence with Gaza, killing about 1,200 people and kidnapping some 250 others. “The atmosphere was extremely emotional,” Yoni said. “Hospitals were completely overwhelmed, both psychologically and in terms of capacity.” “There were instances where I heard staff discuss whether detainees from Gaza should get painkillers. Or ways to perform certain procedures that can turn the treatment into punishment.” Conversations like this were not uncommon, he said, even if actual instances appeared very rare. “I have knowledge of one case where painkillers were used selectively, in a very limited way, during a procedure,” he told the BBC. “The patient did not receive any explanation of what was going on. So, if you put together [that] someone is undergoing an invasive procedure, which involves even incisions, and doesn’t know about that, and is blindfolded, then the line between treatment and assault thins out.” We asked the Health Ministry to respond to these allegations, but they directed us to the IDF. Image caption, Sufian\\'s leg was amputated and he was later released back to Gaza Yoni also said that the Sde Teiman field hospital was not equipped to treat severely injured patients, but that some of those held there in the early months of the war had fresh gunshot wounds to the chest and abdomen. He said at least one critically ill man was kept there because of a reluctance by public hospitals to accept his transfer for treatment, adding that doctors at the base were “frustrated” by the situation. Sufian Abu Salah, a 43-year-old taxi driver from Khan Youis, was one of dozens of men detained during raids by Israel\\'s army and taken to a military base for questioning. He said soldiers carried out severe beatings during the journey and also on arrival at the base, where he was denied treatment for a minor wound on his foot, which then became infected. “My leg got infected and turned blue, and as soft as a sponge,” he told the BBC. After a week, he said, the guards took him to hospital, beating him on his injured leg on the way. Two operations to clean his wound did not work, he told the BBC. “Afterwards, they took me to a public hospital, where the doctor gave me two options: my leg or my life.” He chose his life. After they amputated his leg, he was sent back to the military base, and later released back to Gaza. \"This period was mental and physical torture,” he said. “I can’t describe it.  I was detained with two legs and now I have only one.  Every now and then, I cry.” The IDF did not respond to the specific allegations about Sufian’s treatment, but said the claims of violence towards him during his arrest or detention “were unknown and will be examined”. In the days after the 7 October attack, Israel’s Health Ministry issued a directive that all Gazan detainees should be treated in military or prison hospitals, with the Sde Teiman field hospital created specifically to fill this role. The decision won the backing of many in Israel’s medical establishment, with Yossi Walfisch, praising it as the solution to “an ethical dilemma”, which would remove responsibility for treating “Hamas terrorists” from the public health system. Others have called for the closure of Sde Teiman, describing the situation there as “an unprecedented low point for the medical profession, and medical ethics.” “My fear is that what we’re doing in Sde Teiman won’t allow a return to the way it was before,” one doctor told the BBC. “Because things that looked unreasonable to us before, will look reasonable when this crisis is over.” Yoel Donchin, the anaesthesiologist, said medical staff at the field hospital sometimes gathered together to cry over the situation there. “The moment our hospital closes,” he said, “we’ll celebrate.” Additional reporting by: Naomi Scherbel-Ball, Gidi Kleiman, Aisha Kherallah Related Topics Middle East Israel-Gaza war Israel Palestinian territories More on this story Why are Israel and Hamas fighting in Gaza?

Himalayan balsam can erode riverbanks and grow to heights of up to three metres. The Herts and Middlesex Wildlife Trust said it would use a pathological rust fungus, which was found in the Himalayas, to try stunting the plant\\'s growth. The trust describes the chalk rivers in Hertfordshire as the UK\\'s equivalent of tropical rainforests. Josh Kalms, the people and wildlife officer at the trust, said the invasive flower \"shades out native plants\" which are a food source for some invertebrates. The roots from the plant, which was first introduced from northern India in 1839, also disturb native flora. \"Those native plants with their variety of root structures also uphold the structure of our riverbanks and as they disappear so does the stability around the water’s edge,\" he said. Image source, Tim Hill Image caption, Himalayan balsam have explosive seed pods meaning they quickly spread to rivers after being introduced as a garden plant The trust is trialling the fungus - alongside the non-profit international organisation CABI , external - thanks to funding from the Environment Agency, Affinity Water and Lee Valley Regional Park Authority.

Oswestry Town Council has discussed buying the former Regal cinema and bringing in a national chain to run it. Trevor Harris, who ran the Regal from 1983 to 1994, said his concern was that \"cinemas at the moment, despite what a lot of people say, are in the doldrums\". He added: \"You\\'re talking about a lot of money to get this place going again.\" The town council agreed last week to look at the possible purchase, using money collected from the sale of the former Smithfield cattle market site. The decision followed the closure of a nearby community cinema, Kinoculture. The council also agreed to look at other potential sites, and councillors were told two cinema chains had shown an interest. The building has not been used as a cinema since 1994 and is currently used as a shop. Mr Harris, who still works in the cinema industry, said the work required to put it back into use would be costly and questioned whether people in the town would support it. Image caption, Mr Harris said the building would need its concrete floor removed and soundproofing installing Mr Harris said he was in contact with a lot of people in the industry and books films for a friend with a cinema in Cannock. \"The takings on some of these new films now are shocking,\" he said. \"You get an occasional film like Barbie or Oppenheimer that comes up, they take big money.

Developers for the scheme in Bomere Heath, Shropshire, commissioned an assessment to determine the risk of deliveries being swatted out of the nearby cricket ground. A proposed 15m (50ft) fence was deemed unnecessary after the England and Wales Cricket Board confirmed that the field, leased by Bomere Heath Cricket Club as a second pitch, was only large enough for junior cricket. The club's main crease is further away, about 200m (220yds) from the edge of the development on Shrewsbury Road. The scheme put forward by applicants\\xa0Cameron Galliers Homes Ltd\\xa0would add 62 homes to the existing Wickets development, immediately north of the site. The proportion of affordable homes has been doubled from 10% to 20% following responses received during a consultation on the application. Traffic calming The proposal also included a £50,000 contribution from the developer for a new play park facility, as well as additional traffic measures for Shrewsbury Road. The scheme attracted 19 objections from members of the public, who expressed concern about the scale of the development and the access arrangements for the site, using the same mini roundabout created for the original Wickets development. However, Shropshire Council’s highways department said traffic calming measures proposed by the developer, including road markings and a speed-activated warning sign, would be sufficient to manage the increased traffic. As a condition of approving the application, traffic calming measures must be in place on Shrewsbury Road prior to the first occupation on the site, the planning decision stated.

It is one of the most popular attractions of his ancestral home of Deene Park, Northamptonshire, now owned by Robert and Charlotte Brudenell. The Charge of the Light Brigade was a military engagement of the Crimean War in 1854. \"He\\'s safe here and we can talk to him... well, my husband does,\" Mrs Brudenell said of the horse. Image source, Deene Park Image caption, The Charge of the Light Brigade took place in 1854 during the Crimean War Deene Park, the historic country estate near Corby, was once home to the 7th Earl of Cardigan, James Brudenell. He had his favourite horse Ronald shipped out to Crimea to fight in the battle of Balaclava, and on the 25 October 1854 the pair led the now infamous Charge of the Light Brigade. The charge went down in history as a terrible blunder which saw Lord Cardigan and his fellow cavalrymen ordered to ride straight into the fire of the Russian guns they were meant to be reclaiming. It was later immortalised in verse by poet Alfred Lord Tennyson. Image source, Deene Park Image caption, Charlotte and Robert Brudenell now own Deene Park, the Earl of Cardigan\\'s ancestral home Mrs Brudenell said Ronald carried the 7th Earl safely through what became known as The Valley of Death because he was a \"big, strong hunter and used to jumping over obstacles… albeit these were not usually Russian cannon balls\". After the war, Ronald returned to his stables at Deene, where he remained until his death on 28 June 1872. Before his death he was called into action to follow Lord Cardigan\\'s coffin as part of his funeral procession in 1868. \"Being of strong Spanish blood Ronald was rather frisky and so they gave him laudanum to calm him down… but unfortunately he fell asleep and they had to sound the reveille of the Light Brigade to wake him up,\" she said.

The head now stands in a glass case alongside one of his hooves and what remains of his tail. The walls of Deene Park are hung with portraits of the families\\' favoured horses including a portrait in the Great Hall of Ronald carrying the 7th Earl.

The grey species arrived from America in the 1800s - due to them breeding more and naturally being bigger they manage to snaffle the best food first, resulting in number of red squirrels dropping.

O\\'Neill gave Manchester United defender Jonny Evans, as well as unattached duo Corry Evans and Josh Magennis, the option of not travelling for games against Spain on 8 June and Andorra three days later, but the experienced trio all wanted to take their place in the squad. Winger Paddy Lane, however, told O\\'Neill he felt he would \"benefit from not being involved\". Lane, who has four caps and started against Romania in March, scored 12 goals for Portsmouth as they won the League One title this season. \"We need to get away from that thinking,\" said O\\'Neill, when asked if it should be viewed as a positive that so many wanted to be on the trip. \"I only had one player, Paddy Lane, who said that he felt he’d benefit from not being involved. \"My argument to that was ‘well, that won’t benefit you going forward because you need to commit to international football\\'.\" O\\'Neill added that he wanted players to be keen to \"establish themselves\" in his squad and team. \"We’re looking for that commitment from the players. \"I went recently out to Belgium to watch Isaac Price and he said he can\\'t wait to come and join up in June.

Jonny Evans can come at his age, and Corry Evans and Josh Magennis, and look forward to coming. \"Jonny Evans has over 100 caps and Corry has over 70, Josh is touching somewhere in that region as well. You only get that number if you turn up, no-one gives you them. There’s a lesson there for all the players.\" O\\'Neill said such commitment from his senior players should mean the younger members of the squad \"have little to grumble about\". \"We’re asking them to play in a good climate in a good camp, the players are well-managed. “Really now international football is part of your lifestyle as a footballer.

Medical professionals from 20 organisations have signed a joint letter to the first minister, calling for steps to address problems such as obesity, mental health and tooth decay. Dr Nick Wilkinson, Wales officer for the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health , external , said the situation is “undoubtedly” getting worse. The Welsh government said it was committed to improving health services. Children \\'deserve better\\' healthcare Published 23 January 2018 Under fives betrayed as health declines - experts Published 5 February “Every day in clinics I see increased levels of distress, increasing amounts of tooth decay -  that’s a normal part of our examination and advice now - and an increase in school absence as a result of health conditions,” said Dr Wilkinson. The signatories have created the Welsh Royal Colleges Child Health Collaborative (WRCCHC), which Dr Wilkinson said aims to work with the Welsh government and NHS to “redesign care and really prioritise the wellbeing of children and young people, who are our future generation”. It comes after recent reports from the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges , external and the Academy of Medical Sciences which highlighted the disproportionate effect of poverty on children’s health. \"It makes for grim reading,\" Dr Wilkinson told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast . “The impacts of austerity have been huge, and then latterly the cost of living crisis, the pandemic. All of this has contributed.\" He added poverty was affecting 29% of children, 21% of working-age adults and 16% of pensioners. “It makes for really grim reading, but this is a complex and difficult problem to solve, and there’s no quick fix,\" he said. Image caption, Dr Nick Wilkinson says the signatories want to work with the Welsh government to prioritise early intervention in health Pippa Cotterill, head of the Wales office at the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists, said the pandemic had “a huge impact on the lives of children and young people”. “There has never been a greater need for professional organisations to come together to push for improvements,” she said. This was echoed by chairwoman of the Royal College of General Practitioners Wales , external Dr Rowenna Christmas, who said children’s health must be taken seriously. She added: “We have a duty to preserve the health and wellbeing of our children and young people, and as healthy children become healthy adults, there is a strong economic argument for this.” Dr Wilkinson said: “One pound spent on young people’s health care, especially in the early years, equates to £10 yield in the health economy later on. \"So there’s cost effectiveness to this. But equally we need a greater discourse. It’s not just about health, it’s also about wellbeing.” \\'Early intervention and prevention\\' He said the group believed the Welsh government wanted to focus on children’s wellbeing, “but there is more to do”. “We just want to refocus to early intervention and prevention. We need more innovation and tech specifically targeted at children and young people and the point of the collaboration is that we will sign up to this and develop a whole workforce plan that meets new changes in delivery of care,” he said. The Welsh government said it was “committed to improving health services for children and giving them the best, healthy start in life”. “We are investing in cutting waiting times and the number of children waiting more than two years for treatment has fallen by 75% since April 2022,” it said.

Mayor Alice Guo who is being investigated for criminal operations, was unable to answer questions about her family history and upbringing during a senate hearing. This led one senator to ask whether she was an \"asset\" for Beijing. \"I want to tell the public: I am not a spy. I am a Filipino and that I love my country,\" Ms Guo told the ABS-CBN News channel on Monday night. She also revealed that she was her Chinese father\\'s \"love child\" with his Filipina maid. Her statement came after weeks of intense criticism on social media, where she was the subject of memes that lampooned her forgetfulness on details about her personal life and her supposed ties to China. President Ferdinand Marcos also weighed in, expressing his concern. Ms Guo is being investigated because authorities discovered that an online offshore casino in her town of Bamban was actually a front for a scam centre. Her case is unfolding at an especially tense time between Manila and Beijing , who are locked in a dispute over reefs and outcrops in the resource-rich South China Sea. Why is this small-town mayor accused of being a Chinese spy? Ms Guo said her mother left her when she was a baby and that she grew up with her father at their piggery compound in Tarlac, a farming province north of the capital, Manila. \"I am my father\\'s love child with a maid... It\\'s a very private matter. I can\\'t just tell anyone that my own mother had deserted me,\" she said. She apologised to senators for failing to fully illustrate her parentage because during the testimony, \"my mind just went blank.\" \\'I had no friends and playmates\\' During the Senate hearing, Ms Guo admitted that her birth certificate was registered only when she was 17 years old. She said she was born in a house, instead of in hospital. She also claimed to have been home schooled, but could not give further details. Doubts were further raised when it was discovered that she registered to vote in Bamban town in 2021 - the year before she successfully ran for mayor. Ms Guo said she was ashamed of being illegitimate, and that is why she largely stayed inside the family\\'s pig farm. \"I had no friends. I had no playmates. I grew up hidden in our farm,\" she said. But as she grew into her late teens, she said she got involved in her father\\'s business. She said she would buy corn from nearby Tarlac towns to make hog feed. Aside from scant details about her birth and education, lawmakers also questioned how Ms Guo could know nothing about the criminal activities hiding under the offshore casino. These are known as Philippine Offshore Gaming Operations or Pogos. China’s spy threat is growing, but the West has struggled to keep up \\'Close enough to see their faces\\': Chased down by China in South China Sea The Pogo that served as cover for the gangs in Bamban was built on land partially owned by Ms Guo, but she said she had sold her stake before she was elected in 2022. Authorities raided the facility last March and rescued close to 700 workers, including 202 Chinese nationals and 73 other foreigners who were forced to pose as online lovers. The eight-hectare compound was like a small city, complete with a grocery, warehouse, swimming pool, and even a wine cellar. The scam centre workers toiled on rows and rows of long white tables with computers. Image source, Facebook/Mayor Alice Leal Guo Image caption, Mayor Guo says she will not resign and will seek re-election next year Pogos flourished during the tenure of Rodrigo Duterte, whose presidency, which ended in 2022, was marked by close ties to China. But under current president Ferdinand Marcos, Pogos have come under close scrutiny after it was discovered that some of them have been used as fronts for human trafficking and online scam operations. Ms Guo was also found to have a helicopter and a Ford Expedition registered under her name but like the land, she claims, these have been sold long ago. During the television interview on Monday, Ms Guo was asked about a viral photo of her with a McLaren sports car. She said the McLaren was loaned by a friend for display at a town fiesta. Ms Guo also reiterated that she was not involved in the Pogo or the human trafficking and scam centres. \"I am not that powerful. I am just a simple citizen from a second-class municipality. I don\\'t have those kinds of connections,\" she said. President Ferdinand Marcos has ordered authorities to investigate Ms Guo\\'s citizenship and make sure that foreigners are not allowed to hold public office. \"I have heard talk that I would be deported. My own mother left me. Now, will my own country deport me too?\" she said. She said she would seek re-election next year.

Birmingham City’s form perked up significantly, and the back-to-back wins over Blackburn and Sunderland in February hinted at a run to Championship safety. Owner Tom Wagner and CEO Garry Cook may well have viewed Mowbray as exactly the right character to confront the challenge of League One, a path he has trodden successfully before. Now they find themselves looking for a new manager again - a fourth appointment in 12 months after Rooney, Mowbray and Rowett. It is one they need to get right, although they will not want to deviate from their desire to see attractive, progressive football being played. With the eye-opening plans for the future of Blues, it is a very enticing job for an ambitious coach. But it will come with an instant pressure to succeed.

       " 'Ryan Sessegnon exit: Tottenham player set to seek new challenge': ['Sessegnon ready for a new challenge Image source, Getty Images Nizaar Kinsella BBC Sport football news reporter Published 1 hour ago Ryan Sessegnon is ready to leave Tottenham on a free transfer this summer. The 24-year-old winger is keen for a new challenge at a Premier League rival next season and wants to move when his contract expires despite Spurs holding an option to keep him for a further year. Sessegnon played just once this season, a seven-minute substitute appearance against Burnley in the FA Cup in January, during an injury-hit season in North London. The former England Under-21 international has suffered chronic hamstring problems and has had two surgeries to rebuild his career, the latest coming in February after a setback while playing in an academy match. However, he is nearing his return as he steps up his rehabilitation and is keen to get back playing first-team football. Spurs will look for a replacement forward to bolster manager Ange Postecoglou’s options next season. Sessegnon joined Spurs for £25million from Fulham in 2019 after winning the Championship Player of the Year award during the Cottagers’s promotion-winning campaign.

Image source, SNS Image caption, James Forrest, Ben Doak and Ryan Fraser (left to-right) are among those being suggested for places in the Scotland squad Published 34 minutes ago The excitement is mounting as Euro 2024 edges closer, with just over three weeks until the tournament kicks off. The buzz builds again on Wednesday when Scotland head coach Steve Clarke names a 28-man squad. Two unlucky souls will be trimmed from the pack on 7 June, with warm-up friendlies against Gibraltar and Finland to come. A few regulars are missing through injury and some more are doubts. So, who will make the cut for mouthwatering Group A games against Germany, Switzerland and Hungary - and hopefully beyond? On the eve of Clarke's eagerly anticipated announcement, some of BBC Scotland's football pundits have a go at picking their squads... Scotland squad selection preview Scotland's Hickey to miss Euro 2024 Published 16 hours ago Key questions in Clarke's Scotland squad selection Published 18 hours ago Image source, BBC Sport Former Scotland midfielder Leanne Crichton, who appeared at Euro 2017 and the 2019 Women's World Cup, suggests Sturm Graz right-back Max Johnston as a solution to the absence of Aaron Hickey and Nathan Patterson. The uncapped 20-year-old has an Austrian Bundesliga winners' medal but only started twice in the league, making regular appearances from the bench. There are also places for Aberdeen midfielder Connor Barron and Kilmarnock winger Danny Armstrong. Image source, BBC Sport For Peter Grant, his former club Celtic's stand-in right-back Anthony Ralston would get the nod. Like all the others, he is backing a recall for James Forrest, while there is a shout for Bristol City striker Tommy Conway, who has looked lively at under-21 level. Danny Armstrong gets a spot, injury-hit stalwart Grant Hanley misses out and there is a surprise inclusion of Motherwell's 17-year-old talent Lennon Miller. Image source, BBC Sport Former Scotland winger Neil McCann also makes room for Ralston, who has eight caps and one international goal. He is the only one campaigning for Hearts-bound Blair Spittal, who had an excellent season with Motherwell, and ex-Rangers and Livingston forward Ryan Hardie. The 27-year-old has scored 13 goals for Plymouth Argyle this term. Michael Stewart is the only pundit picking four goalkeepers and retains Motherwell's Liam Kelly, who gets the chop from the rest. The former Hearts and Hibs midfielder would like to see David Turnbull, now of Cardiff City, recalled, along with winger Ryan Fraser, who has helped Southampton reach the Championship play-off final. Liam Cooper and Greg Taylor get left behind, with just eight defenders selected, while Vancouver Whitecaps playmaker Ryan Gauld is the wildcard entry here. Image source, BBC Sport Sportscene host Steven Thompson is the only one campaigning for Liverpool youngster Ben Doak to make the trip to Germany. The 18-year-old forward had knee surgery in December and has only just returned to training. Danny Armstrong pops up again after his six goals and 10 assists in the Premiership.

The figure was up from 36.7% in the previous census in 2011. Other UK countries have also seen an increase in \"no religion\" but the latest figure for England and Wales is much lower than in Scotland (37.2%). The Church of Scotland remains the largest religious group but its numbers have halved since 2001 from 42.4% to just 20.4% in the latest census. The next largest religious groups were Roman Catholic (13.3%), \"Other Christian\" (5.1%) and \"Muslim\" (2.2%). The percentage of people with no religion has increased across all age groups since the 2011 census. Young people are more likely to say they have no religion than people in older age groups but the number of people in the over-65 age group with no religion has more than doubled since 2011 - an increase of 186,700 people. \"No religion\" was the most common response in every council area in Scotland except in Na h-Eileanan Siar (Western Isles) and Inverclyde.

Crews were collecting rubbish in the Elliott Road area of March, Cambridgeshire, when they noticed smoke from the back of the lorry on 11 May. Four tonnes of waste went up in flames, which the fire service believed was caused by a lithium-ion battery.

In a statement to the student newspaper Trinity News , external , Mr Molnárfi said: “If a loss of revenue coincided with peaceful protests as outlined by the College, none of which resulted in any arrests by An Garda Síochána, then such is a cost to the university of operating in a liberal democracy where peaceful protest is both lawful and encouraged.” \\'Disgraceful attempt to silence\\' In a previous statement, TCD said it is a not-for-profit organisation that \"cannot survive solely on government funding and depends on other sources of income\". \"The income generated from the Book of Kells is vital to keep the university going and it supports initiatives such as student services, the student hardship fund etc,\" a spokesperson said.

The Social Democrats TD Gary Gannon said that TCD “should be ashamed of this blatant attempt to suppress student protest”.

The letter states that she was \"a participant in disruptive events that impacted normal College operations\", which \"amounts to a breach of College regulations\".

It was initially reported that the helicopter carrying the men and their entourage had made a hard landing in foggy conditions. The area where the aircraft came down is close to the border with Azerbaijan, where Mr Raisi had been meeting President Ilham Aliyev. According to local media he was there to open the Qiz Qalasi and Khodaafarin dams. On Monday, the Iranian Red Crescent confirmed the bodies of the president and others who died in the crash had been recovered and search operations had ended. \"We are in the process of transferring the bodies of the martyrs to Tabriz [in Iran\\'s north-west],\" the organisation\\'s chief said on state TV. Iranian news outlet Tasnim, which is affiliated to the country\\'s Islamic Revolution Guards Corps, reported that a funeral process for Mr Raisi will be held on Tuesday in Tabriz.

The actress said she had previously turned down an approach by the company to voice its new chatbot, which reads text aloud to users. When the new model, called Sky, debuted last week commentators were quick to draw comparisons between the chatbot\\'s tone and Johansson\\'s in the 2013 film Her. OpenAI said on Monday that it would remove the voice, but insisted that it was not meant to be an \"imitation\" of the star. However, Johansson accused the company, and its founder Sam Altman, of deliberately copying her voice, in a statement seen by the BBC on Monday evening. “When I heard the released demo, I was shocked, angered and in disbelief that Mr Altman would pursue a voice that sounded so eerily similar to mine,\" she wrote. \"Mr Altman even insinuated that the similarity was intentional, tweeting a single word \\'her\\' - a reference to the film in which I voiced a chat system, Samantha, who forms an intimate relationship with a human.\" Set in the near future, 2013 film Her sees Joaquin Phoenix fall in love with his device\\'s operating system, which is voiced by Ms Johansson.

End of twitter post by Sam Altman The actress, who has been nominated for two Academy Awards, said she had been initially approached by Mr Altman about voicing the new chatbot in September. \"[Mr Altman] told me that he felt that by my voicing the system, I could bridge the gap between tech companies and creatives and help consumers to feel comfortable with the seismic shift concerning humans and AI,\" Johansson wrote. \"He said he felt that my voice would be comforting to people.\" But she eventually rejected the offer for personal reasons, she said. Two days before the Sky chatbot was released, she added, Mr Altman contacted her agent, urging Johansson to reconsider her initial refusal to co-operate with the company. Adding that she had been forced to hire lawyers, the actress said she had sent two legal letters to the company, to establish how the voice had been made. \"In a time when we are all grappling with deepfakes and the protection of our own likeness, our own work, our own identities, I believe these are questions that deserve absolute clarity,\" she wrote. In a statement shared with the BBC by OpenAI, Mr Altman denied that the company had sought to imitate Johansson\\'s voice. \"The voice of Sky is not Scarlett Johansson\\'s, and it was never intended to resemble hers,\" he wrote. \"We cast the voice actor behind Sky’s voice before any outreach to Ms Johansson. Out of respect for Ms Johansson, we have paused using Sky’s voice in our products. We are sorry to Ms Johansson that we didn’t communicate better.” Separately, the firm said it was \"working to pause\" the voice while it addressed questions about how it was chosen in a post on X, formerly Twitter. In its blog post, OpenAI said the five voices used by its chatbot had been sampled from voice actors it partnered with. Copyright challenges It comes just six months after actors agreed to end strikes which froze the entertainment industry amid calls for better pay and safeguards on the use of AI . Ms Johansson took part in last year\\'s industrial action, which was partly about how studios would use AI to imitate actors\\' faces and voices. The deal struck with studios included reassurances that these would not be used without consent from actors. \"To use someone’s voice without permission feels particularly invasive at a time when distrust of AI and concern over its potential harms are rampant,\" said Dan Stein, head of AI voice licensing company Voice-Swap. \"Whether OpenAI trained their new Sky voice using audio from Scarlett Johansson or a sound-a-like, the fact remains that she refused permission and her identity was exploited regardless. \"It sets a dangerous precedent for copyright and consent if the most prominent company in the field behaves in this way.\" OpenAI has been battling various legal challenges to how it uses copyrighted information available online. In December, the New York Times said it planned to launch a lawsuit against the corporation over allegations that it had used \"millions\" of articles published by the media organisation to train its ChatGPT AI model. And in September, authors George RR Martin and John Grisham also announced a plan to pursue a claim, over allegations their copyright had been infringed to train the system.

Seoul\\'s media regulator said the music video, which has become a hit on TikTok since its release in April, is a violation of the country\\'s National Security Act. \"[The song] idolizes Kim Jong Un and praises and glorifies him,\" Seoul\\'s Korea Communications Standards Commission said in a statement on Monday. The Security Act blocks access to the North\\'s government websites and media, and penalises behaviours and speeches in favour of the regime. Twenty-nine versions of the Friendly Father music video will be blocked, the commission said, but it did not elaborate on how that would be done. The decision was prompted by a request from South Korea\\'s National Intelligence Service, it added. “The video is typical content linked to psychological warfare against South Korea, as it was posted on a channel operated to connect with the outside world and is mainly focused on unilaterally idolising and glorifying Kim,” the regulator said. Why North Korea\\'s latest propaganda bop is a huge TikTok hit Published 4 May This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Media caption, Watch the North Korean propaganda song that’s a TikTok hit The impending ban has piqued the interest of South Koreans, many of whom have checked out the music video since the announcement, according to comments they have left on the video. Some commented that the authorities should leave the video accessible \"so that more people can enjoy the joke\". Friendly Father is the latest in a line of pop songs Pyongyang\\'s propaganda machine has churned out in the past 50 years. The bright-tempoed, catchy hit describes Mr Kim as “father” and “the Great” - terms previously reserved for North Korea’s first leader, his grandfather Kim Il Sung. “Let’s sing Kim Jong Un, the great leader/ Let’s brag about Kim Jong Un, our friendly father,” it goes. Some TikTok users say the tune accompanies them at the gym or while doing homework, while others like its nostalgic style, saying it reminds them of older Spanish and French pop music. The two Koreas have been divided since an armistice ended the Korean War in 1953. They did not sign a peace treaty and therefore are technically still at war. Violations of Seoul\\'s National Security Act can lead to up to seven years in jail, although enforcement of the law has eased recently. There have also been calls to review the law on free speech grounds.

Published 6 hours ago Share close panel Share page Copy link About sharing Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Tamil Nadu\\'s forest department has launched an AI surveillance system to track elephant movement near railway tracks By S  Prashant BBC Tamil The southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu is using an AI-based surveillance system to prevent elephant deaths on its railway tracks. Elephant deaths on and near the state\\'s railway tracks are rising, with 36 fatalities recorded from train collisions in the past decade, according to official data. Eleven of these fatalities occurred on two railway tracks near Madukkarai, where the forest borders the state of Kerala. These tracks intersect with the elephants\\' migratory route to neighbouring forests. In 2021, the state\\'s high court ordered the forest department and railways to prevent elephant deaths on these tracks. The forest department has now installed 12 towers along two of Madukkarai\\'s rail tracks, each equipped with an AI camera capable of thermal and visible light imaging, along with live viewing. Image source, Madan Prasad/BBC Image caption, The cameras used by the AI system have thermal imaging and motion sensor capabilities Project manager Ashish Rajput said that the AI system\\'s cameras, comparable to those used by the Indian Army along the nation\\'s borders, are programmed to even detect humans near railway lines. When elephants are detected within 100ft of the railway track, alerts are sent to forest and railway officials, who coordinate to slow down trains and guide the elephants away to prevent collisions. Four personnel continuously monitor the system in the control room near the railway track. The project, launched in February, has been executed at a cost of 72.4m rupees ($867,758; £683,976), says Supriya Sahu, secretary of the Tamil Nadu Forest Department. Previously, forest personnel conducted regular patrols along railway tracks to monitor elephant activity. Ms Sahu said this method had limitations, and ensuring complete elephant safety from accidents posed \"significant challenges\". Image source, Madan Prasad/BBC Image caption, A four-person team at the control room constantly monitors the system Within months of its implementation, the AI system has detected nearly 400 instances of elephants approaching railway tracks and promptly reported to railway authorities, thus preventing potential accidents, she said. \"Alerts are sent if any animal, not just elephants, is found nearing the track,\" say Mr Manikandan, who works at the control room. This is not the first time AI is being used to protect wildlife in India. In December, India\\'s federal railway ministry said it was implementing an AI-based surveillance system - called Gajraj , external - in elephant corridors across several states in the country. Under this project, officials are installing sensors using AI tech near railway tracks which send notifications to alert the railway administration and the forest department about the movement of the elephants, other animals, and humans to prevent accidents. Image source, Madan Prasad/BBC Image caption, Train pilots say they now get real-time alerts about animal movement on the tracks even at night In African countries like Gabon , external , Kenya and Botswana , external , AI camera systems are being used for elephant conservation efforts. Tamil Nadu has announced plans for its expansion of the new system to five other vulnerable areas in the state, including Coimbatore, Dharmapuri, Hosur, and Gudalur. \"Technological interventions significantly reduce train-related accidents involving wildlife,\" Ms Sahu said.

The government already runs intensive training \"bootcamps , external \" to help people out of work retrain in many sectors, but new plans will focus on jobs hit hardest by labour shortages from new migration rules. Mel Stride said the UK had relied on foreign labour \"for too long\". But industry figures suggested the plans may not be enough for British businesses that are at \"breaking point\". What is the minimum salary UK visa applicants need? Published 11 April Jenrick insists UK workers will fill labour gaps Published 5 December 2023 Labour also dismissed the proposals as a \"talking shop\" that would not deal with the scale of the problem. The plans, overseen by a new ministerial taskforce headed by Mr Stride, come ahead of official net migration statistics set to be published on Thursday. Net migration in the UK - the difference between the number of people coming and those leaving - hit a record high of 745,000 in 2022. Since then, the government has announced a set of measures aimed at significantly cutting the number of people entering Britain. These include drastically hiking the salary threshold for skilled workers to £38,700 and reforms to make it harder for Britons earning under the national average to bring over foreign spouses. Mr Stride said the new rules, which aim to reduce the number of people arriving in Britain by 300,000, present a \"recruitment challenge\" for employers. He insisted the government was building a new economic model \"based on British talent\". Under the latest plans, benefits claimants would be given training for roles in key sectors facing shortages including hospitality, care, construction and manufacturing. The new model will be partly based on the measures introduced in 2021 to target a chronic shortage of HGV drivers, which included skills \"bootcamps\" and Jobcentre training schemes. Mr Stride said: \"It\\'s a plan providing more opportunities for people here at home to get on, to progress, and to increase their pay. \"I know this presents a recruitment challenge for some employers in certain sectors, particularly those that have relied more on migration in the past. \"For too long we have relied on labour from abroad when there is great talent right here in the UK - I am determined to put that right.\" Image source, PA Media Image caption, Construction is one of the industries expected to be hardest hit by new visa rules Mr Stride will also chair a new cross-government taskforce to develop recruitment initiatives for industries with major shortages. However, the Recruitment and Employment Confederation questioned the prioritisation of British workers over foreign workers when employers are struggling to fill many job postings. \"The bottom line is that many British businesses are at breaking point because of labour shortages,\" said Kate Shoesmith, its deputy chief executive. \"It shouldn\\'t be about picking winners or employing British workers over foreigners. It is about creating the right conditions for long-term, sustainable economic growth\". Shadow work and pensions secretary Alison McGovern accused the government of \"running down our skills and training system\". She said: \"We now have record levels of net migration. They should be putting in place proper plans to tackle worker shortages and adopting Labour\\'s plans to connect the immigration system to skills.\" Liberal Democrat work and pensions spokeswoman, Wendy Chamberlain, said: \"In many ways this is an admission that the Conservatives have no plan to tackle the biggest reason that people are unable to work, which is that NHS waiting lists are through the roof. \"Thousands are struggling to access the healthcare they need, meaning people are unable to go back to work. \"This Conservative government has neglected our NHS which is continuing to damage the country\\'s economic recovery.

For swimming teacher, Ms Prior-Mckie, she says the reopening of the park now needed to be managed effectively. “It needs to serve the community as well as the tourists. It has to be affordable,” she added. “I really hope we find out what happened with those millions of pounds. It was the town’s money that went into getting the park open.” Image source, BBC/Richard Edwards Image caption, Mums Amy and Demi want to see the new waterpark operator focus on affordability Scarborough mothers Amy Mitchell and Demi Cammish also want to see the new operator focus on affordability. Demi said: “It was good, I went a few times, but it was expensive. Especially with little ones – there were some slides they couldn’t go on because they were too short.” Amy said it cost her, her partner and their two children £60 between them to get in – before allowing for the cost of food and drink. “They definitely need to make it more affordable for families, and to promote it more,” she said. “We had to pay the same as visitors from out of town which was annoying, as it was us that paid for the park – and now that money has been taken away.\" John Sargent said he was never a fan of the park because of its ticket prices – and also questioned what happened to the £9m loan. He said: “It needs fully investigating and the money needs to come back into Scarborough.” Speaking last week, North Yorkshire Council’s Conservative deputy leader, Gareth Dadd, said: “We will now work with the preferred bidder who has experience of operating facilities of this nature and will continue to work towards opening in time for the summer season as we promised when we took this site on.” Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook , external , Twitter , external and Instagram , external .

During peak periods, between 40 and 50 lorries an hour were using South End in Goxhill, residents said. Discussions and meetings have taken place. But now villagers have received a letter calling their contact \"excessive\". In a statement, North Lincolnshire Council said it was trying to find a solution for the whole community. Image source, southend_hgv, Instagram Image caption, Lorries are taking goods from the nearby docks to storage facilities The lorries are transporting goods from the docks to nearby businesses. Claire Ramsay-Mayes, who lives on South End, said on one occasion residents counted 56 lorries in one hour. She said: \"Because of it being narrow, they\\'re having to reverse. You can have numerous lorries having to reverse. There\\'s a safety issue.\" Mrs Ramsay-Mayes said they met with council officers in November 2023. Humberside Police has deemed the road unsafe at peak times and a village consultation was held in January. The South End residents have since raised questions and concerns with North Lincolnshire Council. They claimed, on several occasions, to have had no response. Last week a council letter came on email which said: \"Your contact has become excessive and is hindering our ability to respond effectively.\" It asked the residents not to contact individual officers or members but to only email a customer complaints address. It added: \"We formally request that you comply with the terms of this letter and advise you that if you do not, we will have no option but to review your contact with us and implement our policy in relation to persistent and unreasonable complainants.\" Image source, southend_hgv, Instagram Image caption, The road is narrow so lorries struggle to pass each other Mrs Ramsay-Mayes said: \"When you\\'re enduring this, and all you want is answers and you want help, to be met with no response, it does nothing to help your mental well-being. \"The letter we have received, that to me is bullying. \"We haven\\'t done what is stated in that letter.

       " 'Bid to axe affordable homes from Tunbridge Wells project rejected': [\"Bid to axe affordable homes from project rejected Image source, Silverleaf Group Daniel Esson Local Democracy Reporting Service Published 4 hours ago A bid to remove affordable housing from plans for a development in Kent has been rejected. Developers Silverleaf Group secured permission to build 44 apartments across two four-storey apartment blocks in Tunbridge Wells in March 2022. Initially proposing no affordable homes, Tunbridge Wells Borough Council approved the plans, subject to including 14 affordable homes on the Upper Grosvenor Road site. At a meetings of the council’s planning committee, a bid by Silverleaf to not include affordable homes was voted down. The developers said the project “would not be financially viable” if it included affordable homes. While prices vary, affordable homes must be sold or rented for at least 20% below market value, or as part of a scheme, such as with starter homes. However, financial assessment documents submitted by the developers revealed the firm would make 17.5% profit on gross development value for the 30 market rate homes and 6% for the affordable homes, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service . The application to provide no affordable homes received six letters of objection and was rejected with a unanimous vote. 'Housing crisis' A report by the council shows that there were 827 applications looking for council or social homes in the borough in April 2023. Councillor Peter Lidstone said the borough was “in the middle of a housing crisis”. “I didn’t think it was morally right for a developer to come in and remove the affordable housing element,” he said. “I think the problem is that they’re not necessarily interested in benefiting the local community.” Justin Owens, managing director of Silverleaf, said: “These delays will only result in the viability of the scheme being more challenging, as costs continue to rise while also delaying the delivery of vital homes. “While I understand the contentious nature of this application, we have always maintained the site could not visibly provide affordable housing due to the site-specific constraints as can be seen from the original scheme submission.” Follow BBC Kent on Facebook , external , on X , external , and on Instagram , external .

Government figures show 2,960 children were adopted in England in 2022-23 - a fall of 2% on the previous year. The Consortium of Voluntary Adoption Agencies (CVAA) said children with disabilities or behaviour issues waited 11 months longer than others on average for an adoptive family. The CVAA said the extra wait could be \"really damaging\" for children. \"Self-esteem and self-worth is certainly one consideration,\" chief executive Satwinder Sandhu said. \"It can mean they can\\'t focus on childhood, on education, on thriving because all of their anxiety and emotions are being consumed by this unknown.\" Joanne and Dominic adopted their eight-year-old daughter, who is deaf and wears hearing aids, in 2020 when she was aged five. \"She\\'s a complete bundle of energy, really creative and with a great sense of humour - it\\'s like she\\'s always been here,\" Joanne said. The couple from South Yorkshire said they quickly overcame any initial apprehensions. Joanne said: \"I thought, well I don\\'t know sign language, I don\\'t know anybody in the deaf community, I don\\'t know much about hearing loss at all but I can learn. \"Some people say she\\'s so lucky to have had us but we are the lucky ones.\" Image caption, Joanne and Dominic adopted their daughter in 2020 Dominic said he hoped other families would be able to overcome any reservations they had. \"There are so many kids out there needing homes,\" he said. \"It feels criminal to not at least contemplate doing it and to look into it as an option if you feel it\\'s right for you.\" The number of children being adopted across England has been steadily declining since a peak in 2015, despite an increase in children entering the care system. The CVAA, which provides support and guidance to people interested in adoption, said adoption statistics have been affected by the increased use of kinship care placements. Improvements in fertility treatments and the impact of the cost of living crisis had also impacted rates, it said. As of 31 December 2023, 2410 children in England were ready for adoption but a family hadn\\'t yet been found, according to the Coram charity. This was an increase of 14% from the year before, data showed. \"For children who are vulnerable and need adoption, it can mean this is a life-changing moment that gives them access to a whole host of opportunities to thrive that they may not have had otherwise,\" Mr Sandhu said.

Emma Daniels said \"nobody stopped to help\" her son Matthew Schofield after he was assaulted in Leicester in 2023. The 34-year-old was found in Belgrave Road in the early hours of 11 June, before being pronounced dead . Mrs Daniels said her son \"dying alone\" was one of the most difficult things she had to accept. A murder investigation into Mr Schofield\\'s death is ongoing, with a total of 16 people arrested in connection with his death. Nobody has been charged. Now Mrs Daniels wants to introduce a law that would mean people have a duty to stop and help someone who appears to be in physical danger, without risking their own safety. She said the proposed bill, which she calls Matthew\\'s Law, would mean people have a legal duty to call for professional help for a person in danger, or face legal implications for ignoring them. Image source, Emma Daniels Image caption, Flowers at the scene where Mr Schofield died Det Insp Mark Parish, from the East Midlands Special Operations Unit (EMSOU) murder investigation team, said in a BBC Crimewatch appeal in March that Mr Schofield could still be alive if someone went to his aid sooner. His mum said her son was lying \"face down\" for at least an hour and a half. She said: \"I cannot believe that nobody saw him. An hour and a half is so crucial when somebody is suffering. \"I don\\'t know how he was feeling, I don\\'t know whether he was conscious - I haven\\'t got a clue and that\\'s something that should just never happen again.\" She added: \"I know nobody stopped because I\\'ve seen the CCTV footage.\" Do similar laws exist already? Similar laws are currently upheld in countries around the world, including many European nations as well as some US states. Under the German criminal code , external , a person can commit a crime by failing to render assistance in the event of an accident or common danger or distress where it is necessary and reasonable without it being a danger to themselves. A failure to assist a person can lead to a custodial sentence of up to one year or a monetary penalty. In 2017, a judge imposed heavy fines on three people in the Germany city of Essen for ignoring an elderly man who collapsed next to bank cash machines. The French penal code , external says a person can be punished by a fine or imprisonment for refraining from preventing a crime or offence against the \"physical integrity of a person\", or for wilfully refraining from giving a person in danger assistance - both without risk to themselves. Since Mr Schofield\\'s death, Mrs Daniels has held two vigils at the scene where he was found, with both held roughly about the same time he was left lying on the ground. She said during one vigil, she counted \"hundreds of cars\" pass by, as well as people walking past, and that she could \"only assume\" it was as busy on the night her son died. The 53-year-old, who is a nurse, said being able to reassure a patient at the end of their life was \"one of the biggest honours\". \"That\\'s what everybody should have. I don\\'t know how long he was suffering, but he was on his own for a long, long time and he didn\\'t deserve that,\" she said. Image caption, Mrs Daniels is still appealing for anyone with information about her son\\'s death to go to the police Prof Sally Kyd, the head of Leicester Law School at the University of Leicester, said she did not believe such a bill would get parliamentary support. She said: \"There\\'s lots of reasons why. One being this idea of autonomy, the other being how you would enforce it.\" The criminal law professor questioned whether \"already stretched\" police forces would have to find people who \"may have walked by\" a person in danger, whilst also trying to find the perpetrator of a crime. She added in previous discussions among pupils, some students held the view that \"criminal law should be used to enforce morals\", while others said \"people should be free to go about their business without worrying about whether their becoming involved in what could be a dangerous or traumatic situation\". Image source, Leicestershire Police Image caption, Mrs Daniels said she \"can\\'t stop the feeling of panic\" knowing she will never see her son again Mrs Daniels\\'s petition would need at least 10,000 signatures before it can get a response from the government, and it can only be considered for debate in Parliament after 100,000 signatures. She said although she knew that it would be difficult to achieve, she believed others would agree that such a law should be considered.

Lurking in the shadows, a gunman fired three shots at close range. Graham managed to haul himself to the Queen\\'s Head pub to raise the alarm but his life was quickly slipping away. Thirty years on, the murder of the dad of four - who also ran a pub and club protection empire - is still unsolved. Bouncer Viv Graham\\'s death continues to cast a long shadow over the family he left behind. His son, also called Viv Graham, has opened up about his notorious father for the new BBC podcast Gangster: The Story of Viv Graham . It\\'s set in a world of gang wars, retribution and bloody battles to control the supply of drugs into Tyneside\\'s pubs and clubs. Viv senior\\'s former partner says her fiancée did not sell drugs himself but would allow certain dealers to operate in return for backhanders. This was an era long before door staff were vetted and regulated. Back then, you rose to the top through aggression and sheer violence and Viv senior had convictions for assault. When the party drug ecstasy landed in the late 1980s, it sparked vicious battles among the criminal underworld. But populating this dangerous community were people who also had young families. Viv junior says his was sorely tested by his father\\'s brutal murder. He was just four at the time but says his older brother, Dean, who had not been involved in his father\\'s business, struggled for years to comprehend what had happened. Image source, Graham family Image caption, Viv Graham senior\\'s son Dean, right, died of an overdose at 24 \"That\\'s why he turned to the drugs - he couldn\\'t cope,\" Viv says. He watched helplessly as his big brother became gripped by addiction. \"He wasn\\'t the same kid as I remember growing up,\" he says. He became \"something he shouldn\\'t have been\" as his heroin addiction took hold, leading to multiple spells in prison. Viv recalls several times his brother keeled over after taking the drug and he had to help bring him round. In March 2010, Dean died aged 24 after an overdose, leaving his partner and one-year-old daughter. He might have had a troubled life but he had been a father figure to Viv and had tried his best for him. Viv was devastated. \"I struggled,\" he says. \"I hit the drugs and went down a bumpy road. I didn\\'t know what to do.\" Soon Viv who, like his dad and brother, had been a promising boxer, was racking up convictions, including for violence. His life was spiralling out of control and he was in real danger of adding to his family\\'s tragic history.

Today he\\'s a happily married father-of-two who works in the asbestos removal industry. He\\'s also 34, the same age his dad was when he was murdered. It\\'s a grim reminder of his family\\'s dark past but Viv says he is proud to be building a brighter legacy for his own children. \"I don\\'t want my son or my daughter growing up to believe I was bad,\" he says. \"I want them growing up properly. I don\\'t want them turning into something that I was or Dean was or my dad was - so life\\'s different for them.\" Speaking to the BBC, Viv senior\\'s fiancée, Anna Connelly, has reflected that - given his criminal connections - he did not expect to live past 40. But, while his murder remains unsolved, his family are unable to let his memory rest.

       " 'Queensbury Tunnel 150th anniversary prompts calls for reopening': ['Tunnel anniversary prompts calls for reopening Image source, Forgotten Relics Image caption, The Queensbury Tunnel links Bradford and Halifax in West Yorkshire Julia Bryson BBC News Published 4 hours ago Campaigners calling for a disused railway tunnel to be brought back into use say its reopening would be a way of honouring those who built it 150 years ago. Work to construct the Queensbury Tunnel, which links Bradford and Halifax in West Yorkshire, began on 21 May 1874. Norah McWilliam, of the Queensbury Tunnel Society, said it was now \"time to end the uncertainty\" over its future. The society wants the 1.4-mile (2.25km) route to become a traffic-free \"greenway\" for walkers and cyclists. The railway line closed in 1956, with the tunnel owned by the Department for Transport. It is maintained on its behalf by National Highways\\' Historical Railways Estate, which has been approached for comment. Image source, Queensbury Tunnel Society Image caption, A study has taken place into whether it should be turned into a cycle route Ms McWilliam said engineer John Fraser and the workers who built the tunnel left an \"extraordinary legacy\". \"We’ve worked hard as advocates for the tunnel’s potential as a strategic connector and it’s clear that many stakeholders see that value,\" she said. \"What’s needed now is a practical commitment to join together the communities along the three legs of the proposed active travel network to make a positive, long-term difference.\" A campaign to secure the tunnel for future use was launched in 2013, with former transport minister Grant Shapps allocating £1m to the tunnel in 2020 to help develop a business case for the route. A feasibility study into the costs and technical challenges of repurposing the structure has been carried out, but the results are yet to be revealed. Bradford Council said the report would be published in due course. Image source, Queensbury Tunnel Society Image caption, The tunnel was constructed over four years and was completed in 1874 At least 10 men lost their lives during the four years it took to complete the tunnel, campaigners said. Graeme Bickerdike, engineering coordinator for the Queensbury Tunnel Society, said: “The enterprise, courage and tenacity shown by the Victorians - driving the tunnel through the hill in unimaginable conditions - contrasts starkly with the destructive ambitions of National Highways who only see the structure as a liability. \"Whilst it presents many challenges it also offers compelling social and economic benefits as we transition to more sustainable forms of transport.” Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook , external , X (formerly Twitter) , external and Instagram , external .

He said: \"We\\'re under huge stress which is completely unnecessary and it\\'s entirely down to Thames Water and their attitude to their customers.\" Thames Water said it was \"very sorry\". The cause of the flooding has not been found by the water company. Mr Price said his and Patricia\\'s home was no longer habitable after the ground floor toilet backed up leaving up to 3in (7cm) of raw sewage in some rooms.

The houses (HMOs) see people who are not related sleeping in separate rooms but sharing facilities such as kitchens or bathrooms. The number of licensed HMOs in the region nearly trebled between 2013 and 2018, but over the last three years there has been a dip, according to figures from councils compiled by property experts Searchland. The National Residential Landlords Association (NRLA) has warned the government it was becoming \"significantly more difficult\" for landlords to operate the homes. Image caption, Graduate Jack Benson is a tenant in a HMO in Liverpool It said new regulations, high interest rates, inconsistent licensing regulations and unfavourable tax policies had forced many landlords to sell the \"desperately needed\" homes. There were nearly 9,500 licensed HMOs across north-west England last year, more than ever, but Searchland said they had begun to slow down. HMO managing agent Wendy Whittaker-Large said \"more and more paperwork and more and more administration\" was \"putting many people off wanting to invest\". The NRLA said licensing had \"a role to play in ensuring the safety of rented property\", but the government \"must act urgently\" to enable landlords to stay in the private rented sector to increase the availability and affordability of homes. New legislation introduced in 2018 meant all HMOs housing five or more people from two or more separate households must be licenced by the local authority, and requires the landlord to agree to a series of conditions and allow their properties to be inspected and certified. The government said the legislation would \"raise standards\". Image caption, Concerns have been raised about HMOs leading to fly-tipping and other antisocial behaviour However, a high concentration of HMOs in some areas have been linked with anti-social behaviour and fly-tipping - while concerns have been raised about the standard of some housing. Marianne Marsh has lived in the terraced streets of Stoneycroft in Liverpool for nearly 25 years - but said she had noticed big changes over the last seven years. A mountain of sofas, mattresses, mangled furniture and even a large TV could be seen piled on a plot of vacant land in between the Victorian houses that make up her neighbourhood. Ms Marsh said fly-tipping had happened far more since more of the houses around her had been turned into HMOs. \"It has definitely escalated,\" she said. Image caption, Councillor Steve Radford has voiced concerns about the state of some the streets in his area Stoneycroft ward councillor Steve Radford said fly-tipping and anti-social behaviour resulted in a \"demoralised community\". The leader of Liberal Democrat group said many HMOs had \"absentee\" landlords leading to \"neglected\" properties, and claimed Liverpool City Council was not enforcing many of the regulations meant to govern HMOs. The council said: “HMOs with five or more occupants are subject to mandatory licensing and we inspect them for conditions, standards and safety. \"Tenants can complain about conditions or management of their privately rented home. \"Additionally we provide support for landlords with guidance on property standards. \"We use a range of legislative enforcement powers to ensure landlords and letting agents do not let unsafe housing to tenants.\" The council also said it had recently prosecuted two letting agents for poor HMO management and launched a specialist team investigating rogue landlords and agents. Image caption, The number of new licences issued for HMOs is slowing down in north-west England Jack Benson, 22, is a graduate insurance broker living in an HMO in Garston, Liverpool, because he said the cost of renting his own flat was \"ridiculous for what you\\'re getting\". He said he felt he was still \"living like a student\". \"I\\'ve got this professional picture in my head of what I am at work, and then I come home and that picture\\'s just completely gone,\" he said. \"It just brings me right back down to earth. It\\'s just a complete change.\" A spokesman for the Department for Housing said “everyone deserves to live in a safe and decent home\" and it was determined to \"crack down on rogue landlords\". He added: “We have put measures in place that make it easier for councils to effectively tackle unlicensed HMOs, introducing civil penalties of up to £30,000 and rent repayment orders for a range of offences.\" Listen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook , external , X , external , and Instagram , external .You can also send story ideas to northwest.newsonline@bbc.co.uk , external Related Topics Housing Liverpool City Council Garston Liverpool More on this \\'My kids face growing up in temporary accommodation\\' Published 1 day ago Landlord fined £28k over blocked fire escape route Published 27 March One social home built in town since 2013 - Shelter Published 5 days ago'],\n",

The condition, which can cause chronic pain, affects about 1.5 million women in the country, according to national charity Endometriosis UK. Sir Alec Shelbrooke said the lack of education surrounding it had \"shocked\" him, with the condition taking up to eight years to be diagnosed according to the charity. The Department for Education said the new relationships, sex and health education (RSHE) curriculum has proposals to add menstrual and gynaecological health. Endometriosis is the name given to the condition where cells similar to the ones lining the womb are found elsewhere in the body. Each month these cells react in the same way to those in the womb, building up and breaking down. Unlike the cells in the womb, which leave the body as a period, this blood has no way to escape and can cause inflammation, pain and the formation of scar tissue. Image source, PA Media Image caption, Sir Alec Shelbrooke described endometriosis as a \"horrific\" condition In a parliamentary debate, due to be held on Tuesday, the Conservative MP for Elmet and Rothwell will call for schools to teach children about the condition in the same way they learn about reproductive health. \"So many women don\\'t know what endometriosis is, it has shocked me,\" he said. \"If you don\\'t know what a disease is, how do you know if you may have it?\" Sir Alec said both girls and boys should learn about all aspects of reproductive health. \"I think if more women are aware of the potential problems they may have from a young age, then I think that will actually go a long way to relieving some of the suffering that occurs with this terrible disease,\" he added. Image source, Family handout Image caption, Mathilde Barker was diagnosed with endometriosis after years of pain Mathilde Barker, 20, from York, said she first noticed \"awful back pain\" when she was 12. However, she never made the connection between the pain and her menstrual cycle and believed it was due to muscle strain. \"I saw physios and osteopaths for my lower back and pelvic pain, little did I know it was actually the start of my endometriosis,\" she said. Ms Barker, who is training to become a professional dancer, was in and out of doctors appointments until her diagnosis aged 19. \"I had symptoms like loss of appetite, lightheaded dizziness and low mood,\" she said. \\'Excruciating\\' She continued: \"I developed depression and anxiety, I was medicated and sent to cognitive behavioural therapy for medical anxiety.\" Ms Barker described the pain as \"excruciating\" despite various medication and acupuncture remedies. \"If I had known about endometriosis when I was 12 I would have maybe made the link sooner. \"Young children would know the signs to look out for and they might be made more aware of what\\'s happening in their body and know what to approach their GP with as they grow.\" A Department for Education spokesperson said the new RSHE curriculum, currently open for consultation, will include endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome  and heavy menstrual bleeding. “Schools can further tailor their teaching to address the issues that their pupils face, including focusing on specific questions around health as part of the relationships, sex and health curriculum,” they said.

Trowbridge Town Football Club, in Wiltshire, said the funds for improvements at its Woodmarsh ground would allow it to progress to Step six of the non-league football pyramid. The club, which dates back to 1880 and reformed in 1999, aims to raise half of the money by July. Club Chairman Andrew Meaden said the lights would \"create opportunities for local children to begin their footballing journey\" at the club. The planning application, that was approved by Wiltshire Council on 15 May, said eight floodlights would be installed as well as two new dugouts for home and away teams. A condition was attached to the approval that sets out a requirement for Wiltshire Council and Natural England to ensure the floodlights have no adverse effect on the local wildlife, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. Club Chairman Andrew Meaden said: “It sounds like such a simple thing, but with the floodlights, we are creating opportunities for local children to begin their footballing journey with us aged eight and stay right through into a senior playing career in their thirties and beyond. “We can also expand our youth programme to include floodlit leagues and cups, providing even more opportunities for local players in grassroots football. “We are also evaluating possibilities to recruit a coach and extend our programme to include Under six football in the near future.” The club expects the lights to be used for one or two games per week.

Former computer programmer, Ian Davey, was left to soil himself after being admitted to the Royal Berkshire Hospital (RBH). Mr Davey, 66, said the care he received resulted in his \"humiliation and degradation\". The hospital has apologised and said that what happened was not up to its usual standards. Image caption, Mr Davey is normally assisted by his partner Sherree Ball A brain bleed in 2002 left Mr Davey paralysed down his left side and relying on a wheelchair. But he said he was able to live semi-independently with the help of his partner at the home they share in Caversham, Reading. A suspected case of septicaemia led to him being admitted to the RBH earlier this month. When he asked nurses for help in using a disabled toilet, he said he was told he had to be seen first by a physiotherapist, to determine if he could sit unaided. As a result, he was left to soil himself. He said staff then took more than four hours to change the dirty pad he was resting on in his hospital bed. \"I was quietly seething,\" he said. \"It got so bad, I had to call my partner (who was at work) for help.\" Mr Davey was finally seen by a physiotherapist four days into his week-long stay. They confirmed it was safe for him to use the disabled toilet. Image caption, Mr Davey is now back at home and said there is \"no way\" he would go back to the hospital Mr Davey described the ward where he was seen as \"toxic\", and said elderly patients\\' calls for help regularly went unanswered. He said: \"That is most distressing and really quite disturbing when you are lying helpless in a hospital bed. \"There is no way, on God\\'s earth, I am going back in that building ever again.\" A spokesperson for the RBH said it would be contacting Mr Davey to apologise. The hospital said: \"This is not a standard we accept and we are taking his feedback very seriously.\" The hospital also said the Royal Berkshire NHS Foundation Trust had a privacy and dignity policy which meant Mr Davey should have received prompt assistance and his experience would be shared with staff.

The firm, officially called Hutchison 3G UK, wanted to put the mast near Honeymead, but the application was refused at the national park\\'s planning meeting in June 2023. The firm appealed the decision to the Planning Inspectorate, but it was dismissed again earlier in May. The inspector said the site was positioned on a hillside and the proposed mast and its related equipment would be amid an area whose “distinct feature… is the extensive panoramic views of the hills and valleys”. \\'Harm distinct character\\' He added nearby settlements and farmsteads were “mostly upon lower land or tucked down within valleys”, and that the absence of development on the higher ground “gives it a remote, expansive quality”, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. “Although the mast would be near mature trees, given its height and position, high up upon a hillside, it would be visible from long distances away, including from a variety of public rights of way and viewpoints,” the inspector said. “The mast would be the lowest height that would provide coverage for the operator, but despite this it would be taller than the nearby woodland trees, and also taller than those within the hedge banks that delineate the track and road.\" The inspector said the mobile firm had not made it clear whether more suitable sites were available, and stated there were already two nearby masts, although the company had discounted so-called mast sharing. He added the mast would \"unacceptably harm the distinct character and appearance of the area\". The BBC has contacted the company for comment.

Mr Forshaw had transferred from another force in December 2022 and claimed his driving record was \"incomplete and had not been transferred over to TVP correctly\".

Durham County Council secured the closure of Shop & Go in Annfield Plain for three months, following a court order. A total of 246 cigarettes, 106 pouches of 50g (1.8oz) hand-rolling tobacco and 187 vapes were seized. The cigarettes, tobacco and vapes were without the correct packaging and health warnings. The shop was shut down after two test purchases and several inspections. During one of the inspections, the items were found in the engine compartment of a  car next to the shop. \\'Organised crime\\' Gary Carr, Durham County Council’s strategic regulation manager, said illicit tobacco had a \"detrimental impact on our communities\". \"It has links to organised crime, can harm people’s health, and makes it easier for young people to obtain unsafe items,\" he said. \"It also has an impact on businesses in the area which are compliant.\" The estimated value of the cigarettes and tobacco was £2,502. If sold legally, they would have had a rough price of £6,328.36. The value of the vapes was £1,860. \"This case should serve as a warning to non-compliant businesses that they face the risk of closure and being taken to court if they are found to be selling illicit products,\" Mr Carr added.

       " 'Mount Fuji: Japan blocks iconic view to deter tourists': ['Japan blocks iconic Mt Fuji view to deter tourists Image caption, This is the money shot that draws so many visitors to Fuji Kawaguchiko Shaimaa Khalil BBC Tokyo correspondent Published 4 hours ago A group of tourists wheel their bulky luggage and wind their way through the crowds in search of the perfect shot. They huddle on a pavement opposite a convenience store - but this is no ordinary store. Rising behind it is Japan\\'s highest summit, the majestic Mount Fuji. The snowy 3,776m-peak forms a stunning backdrop for those in search of their next favourite selfie or instagrammable moment. The visitors got what they wanted – and just in  time. Fast forward a few weeks, to this morning, and that view is gone. The once-busy vantage point – the pavement – is now behind a black mesh screen, about the same length as a cricket pitch. The barrier is the result of a chorus of complaints from locals, who say their lives have been disrupted by jaywalking and littering tourists. The picturesque town of Fuji Kawaguchiko has been feeling the impact of a surge in tourism - arrivals to Japan crossed a record three million in March and April, driven up by a weak yen and a post-pandemic travel boom. The screen is a desperate move and a sign of Japan’s struggle to accommodate this many visitors while protecting its streets, its famous spots and its particular way of living. Image caption, This screen now blocks the view of Mt Fuji from the popular vantage point, the pavement It has been an eventful Tuesday in Fuji Kawaguchiko. Japanese officials had announced in late April that they would be putting up a screen – but the hour of installation brought more attention to this rural corner of central Japan. As workers fixed poles and hung up wires to hold the screen, they were surrounded by a scrum of cameras. Tourists gathered as well, curious to capture the hubbub. If the screen is meant to keep them away, it isn’t doing that – yet. Around us, visitors wonder how effective it will be: “It may work for a few days. But I’m sure someone will make a hole [in it] and take a picture at some point,” says Kazakh tourist Yuri Vavilin. He is disappointed he missed the money shot but he says he shall return tomorrow and try from either end of the screen. This dedication is surprising to 65-year-old Kazuhiko Iwama who has lived his entire life in Fuji Kawaguchiko. His house sits opposite the ubiquitous convenience store, with its florescent lights and famous blue sign that says Lawson. “I see it every day from my window, so I really don’t have much to say about it,” he says, looking at the volcano that draws tourists from around the world. “I guess I take it for granted.” Image caption, Locals have complained that jaywalking tourists obstruct traffic to get the perfect snap It’s what many have dubbed a “very Japanese” scene – the banal Lawson shouldering such a spectacular view. It is even known online as “Mount Fuji Lawson”. Mr Iwama isn’t convinced the screen would deter the most determined of tourists. With the pavement gone, he fears more of them will step on to the street to take pictures. He says this is precisely the problem - he wouldn’t mind tourists, if they followed the rules. “They cross the street and they don’t seem to care about the cars at all, it is dangerous. And they leave trash and cigarette butts everywhere.\" This is seen as especially rude and careless in a country with few bins on the street – you are expected to carry your trash home and dispose of it there. The screen was a last resort for local officials. One of them had said earlier in May, “’It\\'s regrettable we have to do this because of some tourists who can\\'t respect rules.\" They did try less drastic measures. They put up big road signs in multiple languages, telling people not to run onto the road. But, they say, these have largely been ignored. Image caption, Mr Iwama says he is used to the spectacular view that is across the road from him When we visited weeks before, the road had local security to prevent accidents. We saw one man blowing his whistle furiously and yelling at jaywalkers to stop. When we tried to approach him, he stopped us: “I need to concentrate please.” On the road, a driver aggressively honked at a camera-wilding pedestrian – a rare sound in Japan - who had parked themselves in front of the Lawson, obstructing traffic. “I think one person posted a cool picture of themselves in front of this Lawson and it went viral and everybody decided ‘I want to go there. I want that picture on my Instagram,’” says Maddison Verb who had travelled here from the United States. She and her two friends had been taking turns posing for the picture. Unlike their serene, filtered photos that would soon be shared on Instagram or TikTok, the scene around them was crowded and tense. Image caption, Coralie Nieke says the experience of getting the photo was stressful “There\\'s a guy working here just to prevent people from crossing the road. It is insane,” said Coralie Nieke, who had been visiting from Germany. “If I didn\\'t have social media, I wouldn\\'t have come here. I wouldn\\'t even have known that this place existed.” She described how overwhelmed she felt by the sheer number of people jostling for that one snap. But, to her relief, she managed to get the “Lawson photo”. Kikue Katsumata, a 73-year-old local who regularly walks her dog in the area, sympathised with both sides: “I feel sad for those tourists who come all the way to see the view and take pictures, but traffic here is quite heavy, and we are all very concerned about accidents.” Image caption, Zachary Tsang (first from left) says he has found another spot for a great photo But now, with the screen up, tourists are still not convinced  it will do the job. “I think they’ll stand on the road to get the shot,” says Australian Maddie Godwin, echoing Mr Iwama’s concern. Other visitors don’t see what the fuss is all about: Wandy Chow, a visitor from Toronto, says, “There are other places you can take beautiful pictures of Mt Fuji.” Her son, Zachary, says he has found another shop with a good view of Mount Fuji. But he won\\'t say where. \"I don’t want people to go there,” he says, smiling, thinking of his next shareable moment.

Image caption, Data centres are where pretty much anything on your phone or computer is stored Tom Edwards Infrastructure correspondent, London @BBCTomEdwards Published 4 hours ago The town of Slough in Berkshire, just outside London, has had a terrible press over the years. Many will put that down to the British sitcom The Office, yet even before that in 1937 the poet John Betjeman wrote \"Come friendly bombs and fall on Slough!\". But that is perhaps changing. With its direct transport links to London, close proximity to Heathrow Airport and fast fibre optic connections, it is said to be perfectly placed for a hi-tech revolution. According to the Slough and South Bucks Observer, the town has \"Europe’s largest collection of data centres\", with 34 currently based there and more on the way. Image caption, Slough\\'s very fast fibre optic connectivity is one of the reasons data centres are based there, says Tom Finch, who works for Virgin O2 Demand for data centres has been growing ever since the internet took off. According to the local newspaper, Slough, which is just outside the M25 and is less than 10 miles away from Heathrow, welcomed its first data centre in 2005. Slough Trading Estate is now considered to be the largest data centre hub in Europe. For those who don\\'t know, these data centres are where pretty much anything on your phone or computer is stored - the Cloud, websites, social media, pictures, music and more. Many of London\\'s banks and emergency services use Slough\\'s data centres. But this is a secretive and highly sensitive world where security is not unsurprisingly paramount. Many data centres do not want media attention and politely declined our requests to go inside them. Even the actual number of data centres in Slough is difficult to pin down. Slough Borough Council says there is \"no definitive record source\" to identify the number of data centres in the borough but it is estimated to be about 30 to 35. So when we were invited in by Virgin Media O2, it was a rare opportunity to see inside a data centre. Image caption, Virgin Media O2\\'s Slough data centre is the company\\'s largest hub in the UK Tom Finch, a technical site engineer who works in the data centre, says the site is O2\\'s largest mobile data centre in the UK and manages traffic for 3G, 4G and 5G customers. \"You have voice calls, you have texts, you have all of your social media platforms like WhatsApp. Everything you operate on your cellular data on your mobile phone will pass through this data centre,\" he says. He says demand has increased since the rise in home working and thinks Slough benefits from very fast fibre optic connections. \"Slough is on the data highway in the UK. It\\'s far enough outside the capital but through here we have a lot of traffic passing,\" he says. Image caption, Dan Goodenough, the technical site operations manager at Virgin O2, says the reasons for which people use the internet has changed over the last decade Dan Goodenough, the technical site operations manager, says they have to predict when people want data and demand has gone up since the pandemic. He says they see \"surges in traffic demand, but also the types of traffic\". \"For example it\\'s home working but it\\'s also online gaming, virtual reality, there\\'s different types of traffic that go across our network today than there was 10 years ago,\" he says. \"The most recent Fortnite download for example, we saw massive peaks in the amount of data our customers were downloading. And that\\'s why we invest £10bn in infrastructure to make sure we can provide the best service.\" Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Slough is just on the outskirts of London, near Heathrow Airport and has direct transport links into the capital So why Slough? According to the website datacenters.com, the advantages of Slough are its strategic location with excellent transport links to London. The proximity of Heathrow is also an advantage. It says the Slough data centre market offers a number of size facilities to allow expansion. And Slough also has very robust and fast fibre optic broadband connectivity. It is situated on the main fibre optic line between London and the US. The borough council says being on the main cabling running out of London to Ireland and the US is an advantage. It says it was the capital\\'s banks that helped create this data centre hub. \"Slough started as a data centre location by banking institutions for their own in-house data centres, looking for locations that were outside of London for emergency planning reasons, but close enough so that the miniscule time delay in transmission of data across the distance of cabling was sufficiently small to not be an issue to financial markets in terms of transaction delays on trading,\" the council says. \"Co-location is an advantage for data centres, so the existing cluster attracts further interest.\" Image caption, Data centres use a lot of electricity and water However, data centres are resource hungry and use a lot of electricity to keep the servers cool and the internet running. They also use a lot of water for cooling. In the 2022 drought, Thames Water looked at how much water data centres in the area were using. National Grid\\'s chief executive, John Pettigrew, has previously said that the power data centres use would increase six-fold in the next decade . He said the grid was becoming \"constrained\" and \"bold action\" was needed to create a network able to cope with \"dramatically\" growing demand. According to the website datacenters.com, sustainable energy is a goal in Slough. \"The International Energy Agency reports that hyperscale data centres, which are prevalent in Slough, have accounted for a substantial increase in energy demand globally,\" it says. \"This has prompted data centre operators in Slough to invest in renewable energy sources, energy-efficient equipment, and advanced cooling technologies to reduce their carbon footprint.\" Image caption, Emma Fish, the regional operations manager at Virgin O2, says Slough is the \"perfect location\" for data centres On the site, Virgin O2 also monitors its phone mast network and its broadband. Emma Fish, the regional operations manager, says data centres are key in the world today and Slough provides the ideal base. \"I think people do realise now how important broadband is,\" she says. \"I think people class it as a fourth utility. When you buy a house, it\\'s the first thing you look at really to see how fast the broadband is and how reliable it is and I think we depend on it more so now than we have ever done.\" \"I think Slough is a key location. Just off the M4, just outside London, I just think Slough is the perfect location for data centres,\" she adds.

White Cross Offshore Windfarm is holding public consultations into its plans to bring the cable onshore at Saunton Sands and to build a new electricity sub-station nearby. The plans, to be considered by North Devon Council, have prompted hundreds of letters objecting to the scheme , external , from members of the public and groups such as Devon Wildlife Trust. A campaign group set up to oppose the plans said the environmental, economic and social cost to the community would be too great. Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Saunton Sands is a popular tourism spot Saunton Sands is a popular tourist destination and forms part of the North Devon World Surfing Reserve - one of 12 iconic surfing locations around the globe. The White Cross offshore wind farm is a test and demonstration project which will have seven floating turbines about 32 miles (52km) off the north Devon coast. Al Rayner, project director, said: “It’s important that we work closely with the community while we are connecting the turbines to the grid and that we continue to listen and carefully consider the views of local people to take account of their concerns. “We also understand how important the tourist industry is in Devon, and we will be scheduling as much work as we can outside of the busy summer months.” \\'Pristine\\' environment North Devon Council previously asked the developer to withdraw the plans but White Cross is pressing ahead. Helen Cooper, from Save Our Sands, a campaign group opposing the plans, said the scheme would cause \"environmental, economic and social damage\". She said: \"This would be industrialising a pristine coastal environment.\" The project would involve the closure of part of the car park at Saunton and Ms Cooper said the building works would reduce parking and put off tourists from coming to the area. The rights for the White Cross development were secured from the Crown Estate in 2021 as a test and demonstration site. White Cross has claimed the project will generate enough clean electricity to power about 135,000 homes. Public consultation events are being held by White Cross on Tuesday at Braunton Parish Hall, from 11:00 BST to 16:00, and at Braunton Academy, from 18:00 to 20:00.

Heavy rain led to extensive flooding in several parts of counties Down and Armagh in late October and early November. Stormont\\'s Department for the Economy told BBC News NI it has so far approved compensation claims for 20 businesses which \"will receive payment this week\". A spokesman said 83 applications \"have been sent to the loss assessor for detailed assessment\". But some flood-hit business owners in Newry have questioned why it has taken so long to process payments. Sugar Island, in the centre of the city, was among the worst hit areas when Newry Canal burst its banks during heavy rain in October. Many of its traders did not have flood insurance and some have spent tens of thousands of pounds or more to reopen. Image caption, Paul McCartan owns a menswear shop which has been in his family for 64 years Sugar Island shop owner Paul McCartan estimates the flood has cost him between £230,000 and £250,000. The Georgian building, which has housed the McCartan Bros menswear shop since the 1970s, was engulfed in several feet of floodwater. \"It\\'s been a very difficult six months with a lot of sleepless nights,\" he told BBC News NI. Image source, Brendan Digney Image caption, Paul McCartan waded into his flooded store to salvage his stock last October A few weeks ago he received \"an offer\" from the compensation scheme, but has not yet received the money. He said the delay was a \"huge frustration\" given the promises of help made at the time. \"People have been very supportive around Newry, and they want to see you back in the high street, but at this minute in time that has all been funded by ourselves.\" Mr McCartan had to ask his bank for help while waiting on his claim to be processed. \"I\\'m lucky that I have had my offer. There are plenty of other businesses that are still dealing with the loss assessor,\" he added. How much help was available after the Newry floods? In the immediate aftermath eligible businesses could apply for rates relief and grants of up to £7,500. In February, the Department for the Economy and two local councils opened the Enhanced Flood Support Scheme , offering up to £100,000 per eligible business. A total of 110 businesses applied to the scheme. Of these 14 claims were rejected as ineligible and 17 have been asked to provide more information. Some 20 businesses are due to receive money this week and will get a share of £1.24m. The 43 businesses, not eligible for flood support payments, will receive a share of £152,500 in \"hardship\" payments this week. Image source, McCartan Bros Image caption, Much of McCartans\\' clothing stock was destroyed in the flooding The compensation scheme\\'s settlements are capped at £100,000 per business, which would mean Mr McCartan must still absorb a loss of about £150,000. \"We had insurance, but not flood insurance,\" he explained - a risk many of his Sugar Island neighbours also face. Despite the difficulties, he is relieved to get back into his own store. \"It\\'s good to be home,\" he said. But having reinvested so much to reopen, he is fearful the 64-year-old family business could sink financially if there is another flood. \"I would be in a position where that could just literally put your lights out,\" he said. \\'Dump everything and start again\\' Around the corner at Sugarhouse Quay, Synge and Byrne\\'s cafe reopened last month after a major refurbishment. It was swamped with canal water and smelly silt on the night of 30 October. \"The water came in and it rose to 1.5m (almost 5ft),\" said Adrian Garvey, co-owner of the cross-border cafe firm. \"So that meant all electrical equipment was destroyed obviously, all furniture destroyed, all the tiles on the floors lifted.\" He said the building needed \"a complete gutting out - remove everything, pretty much dump everything and start again\". Image source, Synge and Byrne Image caption, The interior of Synge and Byrne\\'s Newry cafe after the October floods The cafe owner said it cost his firm £168,000 to replace what they lost. They received £7,500 from an initial emergency grant fund but that was spent hiring skips and workers to rip out damaged fittings. Synge and Byrne also applied to the enhanced compensation scheme. \"We\\'ve been told we should get it - we\\'ve yet to see anything,\" Mr Garvey said. \"We\\'re still out a lot of money but unfortunately we have very, very little choice,\" he added. \"We either lost all the money - lost everything and didn\\'t reopen - or we spent what we had to spend to get the business up and running again so we could hopefully avail of the grant.\" Finding the \\'silver lining\\' Image caption, Adrian Garvey said reopening on Sugar Island was a \"calculated risk\" Despite still being unable to get flood insurance, the firm has invested heavily in its Sugar Island refurbishment. They have hired extra staff, installed more seating and extended the cafe\\'s opening hours. \"What is it they say? Out of every problem comes a silver lining,\" Mr Garvey said. The cafe shares the open-plan building with the Lorsha Design shop, owned by artist and designer Loretta Gallagher. Image caption, Loretta Gallagher was told to pay back her £7,500 flood support payment Her shop is upstairs so it was not flooded, but she could not trade from the building for months because of ongoing repair works. Ms Gallagher also received £7,500 from the initial support fund, but said she was later ordered to repay it because her business was not directly affected. \"Because I had received that and they are saying that I did not deserve it - that I wasn\\'t impacted - that negated me from any future funding,\" she said. BBC News NI asked Newry, Mourne and Down Council if it had carried out any investigations or remedial works along Newry Canal since October’s floods. Its spokeswoman said a multi-agency review into the extensive flooding across south Down and parts of County Armagh \"continues to make progress\". \"Review findings and recommendations will be published as soon as possible in the summer.” Related Topics Floods Compensation Newry Northern Ireland Severe weather More on this story Flood support scheme opens to impacted businesses Published 27 February What can we do to prevent more devastating floods?

A few years ago, the now 20-year-old, who lives in Huntingdon, decided to start writing poetry to process her feelings. More than one million people watched her recent video on TikTok, where she performed a poem addressed to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, after he announced plans to tackle what he called a \"sick note culture\". Here in her own words she describes how she found the courage to share her voice with the world. \\'It feels like I have a bully living with me\\' I first started to struggle with my mental health when I was 11 years old and two years later I was hospitalised. It wasn\\'t until I was 18 that I was diagnosed with anorexia and I started seeing a personality disorder team. Every day is a battle. Sometimes it feels like I have a bit of a bully who lives with me and it can be really overwhelming, I feel things very intensely and it\\'s scary. Anorexia wants you to be the sickest version of yourself and it is a cruel disease. The goal posts shift more and more and nothing is ever enough. The personality disorder makes you feel unlovable, you take other people\\'s emotions on and perceive things to be your fault and it can make you feel, quite frankly, like you don’t want to be here anymore, which is the hardest part. If you need support with mental health, details are available at BBC Action Line . \\'The world needs you in it\\' Image source, Shaun Whitmore/BBC Image caption, Zoe goes into schools to deliver wellbeing workshops In one of my hospital admissions, my doctor sat down and said to me: \"The world needs you in it. You have a voice, a powerful voice and everyone needs to hear it.\" I did not believe it at the time, but now I am starting to share my voice with the world. It started off with just one poem and then as time went on I started to write light-hearted personal poems for the nurses and health care assistants and some patients on the ward just to make them smile and this helped me on bad days. I then started to write more about the things that were going on and the pain I was experiencing inside. I am just writing from the heart. I just write from my past, also my present and I just think about other people who struggle too. \\'Rishi Sunak\\'s speech was heartbreaking\\' Image source, Zoe Cawley/Tik Tok Image caption, The video, which was posted on TikTok, was seen by more than one million people When I heard Rishi Sunak\\'s speech on the \"sick note culture\" I felt like he was invalidating those who do suffer with their mental health and putting everyone in the same boat. I feel like he did not have any empathy in what he was saying at all and for a leader of this country it is very disappointing and heartbreaking. He wants to support us to be able to work but he\\'s not giving us the support to help our mental health. With my poem I wasn’t directing it necessarily at the benefits side it was more about the support. And I just feel like there\\'s so much more that can be done, and so much more that he can do and I just don’t believe he’s doing it. I wasn’t expecting the video to get so many views at all, I wasn’t expecting that reaction. \\'Writing will always be a big part of my life\\' I volunteer and go into schools doing sessions around the five ways to wellbeing, which is recommended by the NHS. This can involve making sensory toys and providing a safe space. You just see the lack of support even in schools. It is about funding but it is also just people being willing to learn and understand, even if they do not go through it themselves. Poetry gives me the opportunity to be the voice for not only myself but also others. Over time my words and poetry subconsciously provided support and comfort to my inner child and teenage self and as an adult who is trying to navigate life whilst suffering with mental illness. I know there are so many people out there having the same thoughts that I have and it is so easy to feel alone. That is why I do what I do, because you are not alone and you are not the only one having those thoughts and not all thoughts are facts. That can be hard to remember. I love to help people and I love writing so I hope to have a career in making a difference to people\\'s lives. What does the mental health charity Mind think? The mental health charity Mind watched the poem on social media , external , and responded, saying: \"Goosebumps, we see and hear you Zoe and we\\'ll fight as hard as we can for you and the millions of others.\" Gemma Byrne, policy and campaign manager for Mind said the charity was \"deeply disappointed\" with the prime minister\\'s speech. \"The rhetoric we’ve heard from politicians in recent weeks is harmful, inaccurate and contrary to the reality for people like Zoe and thousands of others up and down the country. \"The truth is that mental health services are at breaking point following years of under investment with many people getting increasingly unwell while they wait to receive support.\" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"We want to ensure everyone gets the mental health support they need. That’s why we’ve increased spending by more than £4.7bn in cash terms since 2018/19. We are also increasing the coverage of mental health support teams in schools to reach at least 50% of pupils in England by March 2025.\" As told to Amelia Reynolds and Neve Gordon-Farleigh Follow Cambridgeshire news on Facebook , external , Instagram , external and X , external .

Image source, Kavan Chay/Capture The Atlas Image caption, The Milky Way is the galaxy in which we live, and gets its name from its milky-looking texture - which inspired a Greek myth that a goddess put milk up into the sky.

Image source, Lorenzo Ranieri/Capture The Atlas Image caption, Most of the photos are taken at night in places where there's not much light pollution, for example places far away from cities or where people live. This makes the starry night sky much easier to see. This photo was taken in Atacama Desert, Chile, which is actually marked as a mountain lion reserve... so there's probably much safer places to see the Milky Way elsewhere!

The Arsenal defender did not play a single minute in England’s successful Euro 2022 campaign and despite coming away from the tournament with a winner’s medal, Wubben-Moy wanted more. “I looked at a team that had just dominated Europe,” she told BBC Sport. “I said to myself ‘we are talented and if I’m going to try and keep up with this group of players, I have to do something different’. “I would say it took me about a year to figure that out and place myself in that mix. I looked at my approach to the season after and asked myself what I needed to do to get to that top level. “I wanted to do more analysis and look at my games from a different perspective and not just the emotional side. I needed a team around me who could support me physically and mentally.” And so the changes began. Now, two years on, Wubben-Moy has established herself as one of the most consistent defenders in the Women’s Super League after a standout campaign. She has featured more regularly for England, having also played a role in their journey to the Women’s World Cup final in 2023, and will link-up with them again in July when she recovers from a foot injury picked up at the end of the season. “I made small changes with things like yoga and I do more relaxation methods,” she said. “I wanted to pinpoint myself as one of the best centre-backs in the league and force myself into the England team. “That was something that two years ago I might not have thought was possible but it’s been such a conscious thing that I kind of knew it would happen.” How did each club get on in the WSL this season? Published 1 day ago Brazil named as hosts for 2027 Women's World Cup Published 4 days ago ‘She has an endurance, mentally’ Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Renee Slegers (left) and Lotte Wubben-Moy (right) have worked closely together this season Wubben-Moy’s rise from an Arsenal academy graduate to a regular first team player has been an enjoyable one, but it has not always been plain-sailing. Her error proved costly in the 119th minute of their Women’s Champions League semi-final exit to Wolfsburg in May 2023 , but she has bounced back this season with strong performances. Arsenal assistant coach Renee Slegers told BBC Sport: “The biggest thing that stands out is her mindset and the way she takes ownership of everything she can control. “She is very humble. She likes to listen and learn with everything in life. She is a very thoughtful and mindful person. She has an endurance, mentally. She doesn’t give up easily or lose patience. “It’s not that she’s just taking in all the information – she wants to give her opinion too. That’s been great for Lotte this year.” The 25-year-old admitted it was “difficult” when she made the mistake against Wolfsburg but she has been repaid for her hard work since. And her individual accolade this season – picking up the club’s Player of the Season – means she can no longer go under the radar as she has preferred to do in the past. “You can’t do that as a footballer. I don’t want to go under the radar anymore. That’s also a contributing factor to why I’ve been able to perform so well,” she added. “My mindset in general comes from a place of wanting to do well for the [team]. I’ve never been someone that after one pass thinks ‘that was so good’ or ‘that was awful’. “I have a mindset that allows me to take a step back. It’s not just one moment but an accumulation of all those moments.” Analysis, growing confidence and a vision Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Lotte Wubben-Moy was part of the England squads for Euro 2022 and the 2023 Women's World Cup With the help of Slegers, Wubben-Moy has developed key technical areas in her game such as her body positioning, her ability to break the press with her passing and being more aggressive. These were highlighted in analysis sessions which Wubben-Moy instigated having clipped up video footage of her own gameplay in evenings after matches. She talked them through with Slegers and the assistant coach came up with training drills to put it into practise. Wubben-Moy also analyses her opponents and recruited her own team of statisticians – not affiliated with Arsenal - to help her develop personal skills which match the team’s “DNA”. “I think as a player you sometimes need to have your back scratched. I know that I’m a good player but I also like to see it. The more I can see it [in stats], the more I believe it,” she added. “If I’m not looking at a better version of myself than I was a month ago, then I don’t really see how I can develop. If I have the stats, I know I can look at them and say ‘I’ve improved here’.” Wubben-Moy’s development is not complete. Her version is to become a starter for England as they look to defend their European title in Switzerland next year, as well as a leader for Arsenal. “I’m a small cog in a big wheel so I want to do it for the team and not just necessarily for myself. It’s a drive that comes from within, but it’s also to drive others,” she added. “I want to have an impact on others both on and off the pitch.” Slegers says Wubben-Moy is a player that “maximises her capabilities” and sees “the bigger picture”. “It’s all about what she wants. She is very motivated to get the most out of herself,” she added. “With her mindset, she can fulfil her potential. I don’t know where the ceiling is - but that’s the fun thing about it.” Related Topics England Women's Football Team Football Women's Football\"],\n",
       " 'Food price rises returning to normal, Kantar survey says': ['Food price rises \\'returning to normal\\' Image source, Getty Images Nick Edser Business reporter, BBC News Published 21 May 2024, 08:02 BST Updated 2 hours ago Food price rises are returning to \"more normal\" rates, research suggests, although shoppers are still seeking out cheaper own-brand goods. Grocery price inflation - the rate at which prices increase - has fallen to 2.4%, according to research firm Kantar, the lowest since October 2021. The findings come ahead of official figures due on Wednesday which are expected to show a sharp drop in overall inflation. The easing of price rises has raised expectations that the Bank of England will cut interest rates this summer. Kantar said that despite the easing of food price rises, shoppers were still following money-saving habits. \"Typically, an inflation rate of around 3% is when we start to see marked changes in consumers’ behaviour, with shoppers trading down to cheaper items when the rate goes above this line and vice versa when the rate drops,\" said Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar. \"However, after nearly two and a half years of rapidly rising prices, it could take a bit longer for shoppers to unwind the habits they have learnt to help them manage the cost of living crisis. \"Own-label lines are proving resilient, for example, and they are still growing faster than brands, making up over half (52%) of total spending.\" Sales of premium own-label ranges remained popular, up by 9.9% from a year earlier. Kantar also said it expected summer sports events such as the Euro 2024 men’s football tournament and the Olympic Games to boost sales, especially alcoholic drinks. \"During England’s quarter final match against France in the 2022 FIFA Men’s World Cup, take-home beer sales hit their biggest daily takings of the year outside of Christmas,\" Mr McKevitt said. Summer interest rate cut possible, says Bank deputy Published 20 hours ago UK inflation falls as some food prices drop Published 17 April What is inflation and when will it come down? Published 6 days ago Overall inflation peaked at 11.1% in late 2022, but increases in prices for food and non-alcoholic drinks were running at a rate of almost 20% last year - the highest since the 1970s. In response, the Bank of England increased interest rates in a bid to slow price rises. The theory is that if you make borrowing more expensive, people have less money to spend, or may choose to save more as saving rates go up. This in turn reduces demand for goods and helps cool inflation. The Bank\\'s key rate now stands at 5.25% - a 16-year high - but as inflation has fallen there has been intense speculation over when the rate will be cut. The most recent inflation data showed that prices rose by 3.2% in the year to March, although the figure released on Wednesday is expected to see the rate drop close to the Bank\\'s target of 2%. On Monday, Bank deputy governor Ben Broadbent said that a rate cut at \"some time\" over the summer was \"possible\". Get in touch Have you been affected by the cost of living?

A Hull City Council decision record stated it was continuing with its plan to reduce the number of garages amid dwindling occupancy. Councillor Paul Drake-Davis said it would allow the under-used spaces to be repurposed which would benefit tenants and residents.

According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service there are about 4,000 garages in more than 650 blocks across Hull and the current occupancy rate is less than half. The decision record stated they were becoming less popular because of their size and the cost of renting them and using freed-up space for parking would reduce congestion.

But she is hesitant to say the battle is over. \"I still don\\'t trust that anything will happen,\" she said as she waited for the government to announce the compensation scheme. \"Why was this not announced a year ago?\" She is not the only one asking this question. While some campaigners have praised the prime minister for his apology, others have criticised the government for waiting for the full report before setting up a full compensation scheme. Heather says the government has learned nothing in the full report it did not already know a year ago. \"And in that year, so many people have died. Including Perry.\" Image source, Heather Evans Image caption, Perry and Heather Evans were married for 36 years \\'I\\'m so proud he saw our kids to adulthood\\' Perry Evans met Heather in 1987, just two years after he was diagnosed with HIV. He contracted the illness after he was given infected blood during treatment for haemophilia. \"We were told he had two or three years to live,\" said Heather. \"We were married for nearly 36 years.\" The couple were also told they would never have children, but they have a son, Isaac, now 22, and a daughter, Cerian, now 19. \"I’m so proud that he saw our kids into adulthood and he saw our daughter get into theatre school,\" she said. \"He would want them to thrive and fly and absolutely fly. That’s his legacy. \"But there were huge difficulties along the way, huge health crises. And that’s part of the shock that he has gone, because so many things he rose above – time after time after time. So we are still shocked that he’s gone.\" Image source, Heather Evans Image caption, The Evans family had far more time with Perry than they expected In 2022, an independent report by Sir Robert Francis recommended compensation for victims irrespective of the findings of the public inquiry. The UK government said at the time that it accepted the moral case for compensation and made payments of £100,000 to 4,000 people who had been infected. Labour MP Dame Diana Johnson, a long-time campaigner on the scandal, said the government\\'s failure to provide compensation payments to victims following an interim report by Sir Brian \"added another layer of hurt\". Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has called for people to be prosecuted for their role in the scandal. The former health secretary told the BBC corporate manslaughter charges should be brought, and backed Sir Brian\\'s calls for civil servants to be subject to a \"duty of candour\" law, which would force them to \"tell the truth at the first time of asking\". Mr Burnham said this is the \"only way to break the cycle\" that has led to successive public scandals. Related Topics UK infected blood inquiry'],\n",
       " 'Abusers often family members and other children, police say': ['Child abusers often family and other kids – police Image source, Getty Images Tom Symonds Home Affairs Correspondent Published 55 minutes ago More child abuse is carried out by family members and other children than by grooming gangs, according to a new police taskforce. The government set up the taskforce last year to tackle what Prime Minister Rishi Sunak dubbed \"evil grooming gangs\". But fewer than one in five (19%) of the cases it has investigated so far involve networks of offenders. The figures show 27% of cases involved family members, and 22% abuse by other children. When he announced the new taskforce in April 2023, Mr Sunak said: \"For too long, political correctness has stopped us from weeding out vile criminals who prey on children and young women.\" The government said the taskforce would involve \"parachuting in\" officers with \"extensive experience of undertaking grooming gang investigations\". While the government continues to call it a Grooming Gangs Taskforce, the police have since referred to it as the Child Sexual Exploitation Taskforce, reflecting their wider perception of the issue. Better data A key aim was to collect better data about the nature of child abuse. The taskforce set up a new Complex and Organised Child Abuse Database to track the most serious cases involving at least two suspects. Police analysis of the first year, shared with BBC News, shows: ·        6,740 suspects identified, including 550 arrested ·        1,071 suspected of being involved in group-based child sexual exploitation, or grooming gangs Grooming gangs can involve groups of men trying to build relationships with children with the aim of sexually abusing them. The most serious cases in Rotherham, Rochdale, Telford and Oxford led to hundreds of children being abused. Politically correct? At the 2023 launch, then-Home Secretary Suella Braverman, told BBC News that gangs involved in child abuse were \"overwhelmingly\" made up of British-Pakistani males, and suggested the police had been too \"politically correct\" to tackle the problem. What do we know about grooming gangs\\' ethnicity? Published 4 April 2023 Political correctness aiding grooming gangs - PM Published 3 April 2023 According to the new police figures, last year\\'s offenders declared their ethnicity in a third of the complex child abuse cases on its database. Of these, 85% said they were white and 6% Asian. On a visit to Essex Police on Monday, Home Secretary James Cleverly repeated that \"grooming gangs are a problem\". \"We have never suggested they are the only problem,\" he said, stressing the importance of looking at all the possible ways in which children are harmed. Gabrielle Shaw, chief executive of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood (NAPAC), said the government\\'s narrative risked making thousands of victims who were not abused by grooming gangs think: \"I don\\'t count, my abuse doesn\\'t matter.\" \"To frame it like that is not great. We need to change that narrative to reach out to the people who haven\\'t yet sought the support that they need.\" Only 13% of people who said they had been abused have reported it to the police, according to NAPAC research. \"A trust deficit remains,\" said Ms Shaw. While police forces directly investigate allegations, the Child Exploitation Task Force  reviews cases and trains officers to work with victims of abuse to ensure they support prosecutions.

The dreaded two-week trip to South Africa has ended and Glasgow have collected two out of a possible 10 points. The Warriors were put to the sword at the weekend, pounced upon by the dangerous Lions. The hosts lost a player due to a straight red card and played 10 minutes with 13 men, yet the Warriors could not break them down. If anything, the opportunistic Lions were galvanised and played off the scraps of several Warriors turnovers to go down the field unchallenged. All four tries at the start of the second half felt like walk-ins after individual mistakes at the breakdown, and Glasgow had zero answers for them. The writing was on the wall, though, with the wasteful Warriors showing a lack of clarity in the first half. Several times they were within metres of the Lions try-line before squandering the opportunities. This all but ends any chance of finishing top, and maybe even second place, with Glasgow dropping from the summit to fourth after the dismal result. The few positives are this match didn’t bring the squad any more injuries and they return north with a bye week that can be used to gather thoughts before the final regular-season game at Scotstoun against Zebre. Five points is a must but unlike last week, the final destiny of Glasgow’s regular season hinges on other results and not just their own. Related Topics Scottish Rugby\"],\n",

       " \"Edinburgh fan column: 'Second half punctuated was with controversy'\": [\"'First half was controversy free, the second was punctuated with it' Sandy Smith Edinburgh fan columnist Published 34 minutes ago Edinburgh v Munster was game of two halves. Not in the traditional sense, because this was as close to an 80-minute performance as Edinburgh have put in this season, but because the first half was controversy free and the second half was punctuated with it. We'll start with the RG Snyman late tackle. It wasn’t just late, it appeared deliberate. He flinches to the right as he thinks the ball is coming straight at him and then corrects his run and clatters Ben Healy. Even if that’s unfair, the referee’s decision to award Munster a free-kick in a game which up that point had been physical but without needle of any kind was completely over the top. He may as well have just given them the seven points. Edinburgh could have been given a penalty try on 63 minutes. Conor Murray was never onside, he was off his feet and his knocking on of the ball was cynical. Ali Price might have had an easy dive over had Murray not taken one for his team. Might, unfortunately, is not certainty so only a penalty and a yellow card resulted. Scrums are a lottery as an attacking weapon. Munster deployed every trick in the book and managed to waste three minutes of the sin-bin period with resets before the referee made a decision and awarded Edinburgh a penalty. The subsequent try by Boan Venter could have been disallowed but perhaps it balanced out the Snyman nonsense. Ultimately the ghost of the previous home game against Munster came back to haunt Edinburgh. In that match we were three points ahead at half-time and conceded a try and the lead on 41 minutes. This time we were four ahead at the same juncture and it was on 42 minutes when we gave up a try and the lead. At least on this occasion we stayed in the fight. More of that fight will be needed against Benetton if we are to do something we haven’t done since 2015 - when a 73rd-minute Greig Tonks penalty helped us to our last win in Treviso.

The Bundesliga giants have struggled to find a replacement for Thomas Tuchel, whose exit was confirmed last week after initially being announced in February. Bayer Leverkusen boss Xabi Alonso, Germany manager Julian Nagelsmann and Austria coach Ralf Rangnick have all turned the job down. Talks aimed at persuading Tuchel to stay on failed to reach a positive conclusion, leaving Bayern with a problem. Kompany has built a decent reputation during his time at Anderlecht and Burnley, although the Clarets\\' relegation - following lofty pre-season expectations - has not reflected well on the Belgian. However, he has knowledge of the Bundesliga from his time as a player at Hamburg and speaks German. If Bayern were to make a formal approach, it is sure to be attractive to Kompany, who signed a five-year contract extension at Burnley in 2023 but refused to answer questions about his future after Sunday’s season-ending defeat by Nottingham Forest. Bayern endured a trophyless campaign under Tuchel, finishing third in the league behind unbeaten champions Leverkusen and second-placed Stuttgart. \\'A sensational development\\' Shamoon Hafez, BBC Sport football news reporter: From Burnley to Bayern, if this was to happen it would be one of the most sensational stories of the summer. Neither club commented on the speculation when contacted by BBC Sport. Kompany\\'s Clarets stormed to the Championship title in his first season in charge, but their return to the top flight was a real struggle as he stuck to his principles of a possession-based game and playing out from the back. But that stubbornness to not evolve, and countless individual errors, led to Burnley\\'s immediate relegation back to the second tier. Chairman Alan Pace wrote in his matchday programme notes on Sunday about the \"project\" under Kompany, who he has \"full faith in\". Club sources have maintained all season the Belgian would not be sacked regardless of whether they stayed up, so these developments will have stunned the hierarchy. Kompany is adamant he \"never speaks about his future\" and though clearly not Bayern\\'s first or second choice, the opportunity of taking over at one of the most prestigious clubs in the world will surely be too good to turn down.

They will be introduced in Northern Ireland later in 2024. However, there have been a number of attacks involving the dogs, some fatal, since the laws were put in place. Woman dies in attack by two registered XL bullies What is an American XL bully? An XL bully is the largest kind of American bully dog. The UK government published guidance to help identify XL bullies, , external which are not recognised as a specific breed. They are described as large dogs \"with a muscular body and blocky head, suggesting great strength and power for [their] size\". Male XL dogs stand from 20in (51cm) high at the shoulder, with female XLs only slightly smaller. Dogs are considered XLs if they meet the minimum height and a substantial number of other characteristics. How dangerous are XL bullies? When it announced the XL bully ban in England and Wales in late 2023, the government said 23 deaths had been caused by dog attacks since the start of 2021. It said XL bullies had been \"disproportionately involved\". NHS consultant Richard Baker said their powerful jaws inflict more damaging wounds than those of other breeds, resulting in broken bones, shredded skin and damaged nerves. \"It\\'s a crushing or a tearing injury,\" he said. \"Once they grip, they don\\'t let go.\" In several cases, XL bullies are known to have killed their owners, including a woman in her 50s in London in May. Other people killed by XL bullies include 68-year-old Esther Martin , 54-year-old Ian Langley, 52-year-old Ian Price, 65-year-old Ann Dunn, 17-month-old Bella-Rae Birch and 10-year-old Jack Lis. However, there are no official statistics on the overall number of attacks by individual dog breeds. The BBC sent Freedom of Information requests to every local police force in England and Wales. The responses showed that in 2023, police recorded 30,539 offences of an out-of-control dog causing injury to a person or guide dog - a 21% increase on 2022.

Ownership of American bully XL dogs is restricted under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991. Since 31 December 2023, it has been against the law to sell, give away, abandon or breed from an XL bully. , external Since 1 February 2024, it has been a criminal offence to own an XL bully without an exemption certificate. The government said it received 61,000 exemption applications before the deadline. Police can seize unregistered prohibited dogs, and their owners face a criminal record and unlimited fine. Police seize 22 dogs from illegal XL Bully farm Is the American XL bully ban working? Owners who applied for an exemption have to buy insurance, microchip their dog and pay a £92.40 fee per animal. Registered dogs must be housed securely, and kept on a lead and muzzled in public - but not at home. Older dogs must also be neutered by 30 June, or by the end of 2024 for dogs under the age of one. Owners in England and Wales can no longer apply to exempt an XL bully. Anyone choosing not to keep their XL bully had to take it to a registered vet to be euthanised by 31 January 2024. What are the rules for American XL bullies in Scotland? Since 23 February, American XL bullies have to be muzzled and kept on a lead in public in Scotland. It is illegal to abandon, rehome, sell, buy, or transfer ownership of an XL bully. Anyone who breaks the rules risks up to six months in prison and/or a fine of up to £5,000. Owners who wish to keep their dogs have to apply for an exemption by 31 July 2024. Details of how to register a dog will be released ahead of the deadline. The requirements for exempt XL bully owners in Scotland are expected to mirror those in England and Wales. What are the rules for American XL bullies in Northern Ireland? People who wish to keep an XL bully will have to register their dog. Owners will be subject to many of the restrictions in place in the rest of the UK: dogs must be neutered, and muzzled and kept on a lead in public it will be illegal to breed, abandon, rehome, sell, buy, or transfer ownership of XL bullies It is not clear when the new requirements will take effect, but it is thought that the legislation could be introduced in the summer or early autumn. Why do some charities oppose the American XL bully ban? Breed-specific bans do not work and are unfair on responsible dog owners and their pets, according to the Dog Control Coalition.

David Arnold, who was speaking to BBC Three Counties Radio ahead of Radio 1\\'s Big Weekend visiting the town on Friday, said the Bedfordshire town was undeserving of the criticism it often receives in the press. He said: \"You get the occasional piece saying it\\'s the worst place to visit, those horrible things that say it\\'s the worst place to live - it\\'s really not. \"Luton is a place where hard work has to happen. You come out of Luton having learnt a lot about life and what it\\'s like to be a human being amongst other human beings.\" The 62-year-old, who won a Grammy for his work on the 1996 film Independence Day, recalled how growing up in Luton influenced his career. \"I started getting my music education at 33 Guildford Street, which is the old arts centre down there which is not there anymore. \"There was not that many places you could go in the 1980s.\" While there he met teenager Danny Cannon, who would eventually go on to executive produce and direct the pilot for the TV franchise CSI. The two worked together on the 1993 film The Young Americans, which then lead to a role as a composer on Roland Emmerich\\'s Stargate. He joked: \"Being from Luton meant that anyone from Hollywood that was giving me a hard time was going to stand a chance. \"Growing up and playing in pubs and clubs in and around Luton that you see everything, you see all sorts of people with all sorts of hopes and dreams and disappointments.\" Image source, Getty Images Image caption, David Arnold says he received a lot of encouragement as a student The former student of Beechwood School and Challney High School praised teachers he had growing up in the town.

Figures from the British Heart Foundation (BHF) show the Lancashire seaside resort had a death rate of 133 per 100,000 of population, compared with 50 per 100,000 in the least deprived areas – the biggest gap in the country. Manchester, Barking and Dagenham, Nottingham and Hull also saw some of the highest death rates from early heart disease in England. Hart, in Hampshire, Waverley, Mid Sussex and Elmbridge had some of the lowest, according to the figures sampled between 2016-22. NHS pressures The charity said its study showed premature death rates from heart disease reached the highest level in a decade in 2022. It said more research was needed to understand the reasons, but there was an established link between heart health and wealth - with people living in the poorest areas facing poverty, pollution, fewer healthy affordable food choices, as well as poorer working and living conditions. Other factors include more people living with complications linked to Covid-19 and ongoing NHS pressures, the foundation said. It has called for more research and action to reduce the divide between the richest and poorest areas growing further. Men living in the most deprived parts of England saw the biggest increase in premature death rates from heart diseases in 2022, the study showed. Their rate has risen to 153 per 100,000 people up from 129 per 100,000 in 2019. This is nearly double the nation’s average premature death rate from heart disease.

Tackling the many causes of health inequalities is crucial, the BHF said. These include key drivers of poor health, such as obesity, diets high in fat, too much sugar and salt, smoking, alcohol consumption, high blood pressure and diabetes. Chief executive Dr Charmaine Griffiths said: \"We’re in the grip of a historic heart crisis. “It is shameful in this day and age that someone can be at much greater risk of dying young from cardiovascular disease just because of where they live and how much money they have. “More people will lose loved ones to heart disease through no fault of their own.\" \\'Urgency\\' In 2023 the government announced its Major Conditions Strategy , external to help reduce deaths from heart disease as well as conditions such as cancer and dementia. It is due to be published in full later this year. The BHF said an interim report published by the Department of Health & Social Care last summer \"made clear the scale and urgency\" of the rising tide of cardiovascular disease in the UK. \"But as the data now shows, there has been limited progress made to tackle this major cause of ill health,\" it added. Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan, associate medical director at the BHF, said: “The gap in heart health between rich and poor is now widening at an alarming rate, and it’s happening at a time when the NHS is already struggling. \"Urgent intervention is long overdue to prevent heart disease happening in the first place and to make heart care better, faster and fairer for everyone.” Listen to the best of BBC Radio Lancashire on Sounds and follow BBC Lancashire on Facebook , external , X , external and Instagram , external .

Marcel was rescued after a woman discovered the mystery monkey in her house . The Geoffroy\\'s marmoset, thought to be an escaped pet, has now been rehomed to Monkey World ape rescue centre in Wareham, Dorset, where staff realised the extent of his health issues. A spokesperson for Monkey World said they indicated he had been kept in inappropriate circumstances and fed a bad diet for some time. Director of Monkey World, Dr Alison Cronin, said that it was most likely that Marcel escaped from his cage as part of the British pet trade. \"Marcel got lucky, he did not freeze to death while loose on the streets of Wolverhampton and was cared for by Wings & Paws [animal rescue] until a specialist home was found at Monkey World,\" she said. \"It doesn’t matter where he was born or how he was kept previously, marmosets like Marcel need the correct diet, environment, and companionship of their own kind that they can groom, communicate, and form close social bonds with. \"All monkeys in the UK pet trade are deserving of these basic needs.” Image source, Monkey World Image caption, Monkey World believes Marcel was part of the UK pet trade Marcel was immediately given vitamin D3 upon arrival at Monkey World, as the primate care staff noticed he had rickets. He was also given a correct diet for a marmoset to combat the effects a poor pet trade environment and diet has had on the South American primate. Monkey World has rescued over 130 primates from the UK pet trade alone, many of which were kept as solitary pets in bird cages. It campaigns for UK laws to be changed to protect marmosets and other monkeys. A spokesperson for Monkey World said: \"Despite most marmosets being bred in captivity in the UK, marmosets are not tame or domesticated; they are intelligent, social wild animals and require specialist care that cannot be fulfilled in a domestic situation. \"These social monkeys suffer in solitary confinement in the pet trade and the best rehabilitation Monkey World can offer them is a family of their own kind again.\" The ape rescue successfully campaigned and advised the government on legislating the primate pet trade in the UK, which was passed into law in March 2024 and will ban primates being kept as pets without a licence from April 2026.

The baby sihek, also known as the Guam kingfisher, hatched at a zoo in Kansas in the United States last month. The species has not been seen in the wild since the late 1980s but it is hoped an international collaboration between experts will enable it to be re-introduced to its native territory. A spokesperson for the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) said the female chick marked a \"key milestone\" for the project. Siheks once flourished on the North Pacific island of Guam but the accidental introduction of the brown tree snake to the island in the 1940s wiped out many native birds, bats and lizards, ZSL said. The last wild sighting of a sihek was in 1988 and the birds are now considered Extinct in the Wild by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. There are currently only 141 siheks left in the world, all under human care. The sihek recovery program is working to establish a temporary wild population on the American island Palmyra Atoll before their eventual return to Guam, a US territory. Image source, John Ewen, ZSL Image caption, The chick will soon be covered in blue and cinnamon-coloured plumage The chick is being cared for around-the-clock by a team of specialists to ensure the \"precious youngster’s survival\", ZSL said. Bird keeper Charlotte James said: \"With her eyes closed, a distinct lack of feathers and weighing no more than a pencil, this chick entered the world rather strange looking and completely dependent on us. \"But in just 30 days, she’ll have grown almost 10 times heavier and be covered in beautiful blue and cinnamon-coloured plumage.\" Ms James said each individual chick that successfully hatches was a \"huge beacon of hope for the future of this species”. Image source, ZSL Image caption, Charlotte James is part of an around-the-clock team caring for the chick The chick, that hatched at Sedgwick County Zoo, is currently fed a diet of mice and insects by caretakers - but if it is successfully released in Palmyra Atoll\\'s forests, it will need to hunt for food, including insects and geckos, ZSL said. Professor John Ewen, from conservation charity’s Institute of Zoology, said the network of conservation zoos had played a \"vital role\" in saving the species from extinction. “Returning species to the wild is a long, carefully planned-out journey built upon global scientific expertise,\" he said. \"When a species is as close to the edge of extinction as the sihek, low population numbers mean we often face challenges such as a lack of eggs and reduced fertility. \"As a result, only one of the seven eggs that have made the journey to Sedgwick County Zoo so far has successfully hatched – highlighting not only how special this tiny chick is, but why it’s so vital that we continue to build large populations of Extinct in the Wild species under human care and work as quickly as possible to restore their wild numbers.\" Image source, ZSL Image caption, The chick is currently being fed a diet of mice and insects Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook , external , X , external and Instagram , external .

Ian Smith, 64, wrote to organisations to highlight how gents loos lack anywhere to hygienically bin incontinence products. Following radiotherapy and hormone treatment he now suffers from bowel incontinence and wears adult nappies. Nationally, a \"Boys Need Bins\" campaign is calling for a change in the law, to make sanitary bins compulsory. \"Because of my treatment, I suffered damage to my bowels and rectum and that\\'s made me sometimes bowel incontinent,\" said Mr Smith, who was first diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer in 2022. Although he had been having PSA (prostate-specific antigen) tests regularly, this precaution was disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic. By the time his cancer had been identified it had spread to his rectum and is now incurable. \"What I wear is full nappy pants... These are a real issue if you need to get rid of them, which is what the Boys Need Bins campaign is all about,\" he said. \"Because blokes are what they are, they don\\'t talk about it... and so most venue owners don\\'t know it\\'s a problem\".

The batches were so potent that Naloxone - a medicine that rapidly reverses an opioid overdose - was not working in some cases, said Ms Harris, from the charity Open Road. Essex Police officers told the BBC that vulnerable drug users were being warned about the \"deadly\" heroin circulation. The force has made three arrests after three people died in what officers believed to be drug-related deaths in Colchester earlier this month.

The charity worker said dealers had \"stockpiled the heroin and are then drip-feeding it\", while adding protonitazenes, nitazenes , fentanyl and carfentanil to the drug. \"It\\'s killing people,\" Ms Harris added. \"When someone thinks they’re taking heroin, it’s not necessarily heroin – it’s a lot of different things mixed together and it\\'s very dangerous.\" Image source, Lewis Adams/BBC Image caption, Colchester MP Will Quince said drug dealers traded on the \"misery\" of other people The Conservative MP for Colchester, Will Quince, said he understood a \"contaminated batch of heroin\" had killed the three people between 12 and 14 May.

Norfolk County Council is consulting over £2m plans for the Market Gates Bus Station in Great Yarmouth. Currently all bus services operate in a southerly direction, but plans could see one lane converted to northbound. Construction works could begin in 2025 if the scheme is approved. Some other routes will be diverted to use the town\\'s new Herring Bridge from 26 May, improving journey times between the town centre and James Paget University Hospital. Image source, Andrew Turner/BBC Image caption, The western lane of the bus station could be switched from southbound to northbound, shaving up to five minutes off some journey times. The council said new bus stops would be created and crossing points added to neighbouring streets to improve traffic flows. Councillor Graham Plant, cabinet member for highways, infrastructure and transport, said: “Through our Bus Service Improvement Plan we’re committed to improving bus services and sustainable transport facilities across the county. \"This proposal represents another major investment in Great Yarmouth which seeks to build on the fantastic progress we’ve already made with the low fare cap and a number of new and enhanced bus services introduced across the region. “Herring Bridge has already made a massive difference to traffic flows around the town and these proposals seek to capitalise on this shift to ensure our bus infrastructure is fit for purpose to support the future growth of the region with all of the wider investments currently being made.\" New bus stops and pedestrian crossings would be added at the Market Gates Bus Station and on approach roads. Some one-way streets would be reversed, allowing access to the new stops, with northbound buses now able to run through the bus station. Also, cars exiting Market Gates Shopping Centre car park will be allowed to turn right onto Temple Road, which would relieve traffic on the Regent Road pedestrian crossing.

Media caption, Government says sorry for Youth Parliament problems The government has said sorry for the disruption to the UK\\'s parliament for kids after money problems stopped the scheme. The UK Youth Parliament was put on pause in March, when financial issues caused the charity in charge of running it to shut down unexpectedly. Shalom, a Member of the Youth Parliament (MYP), said the pause had been \"disheartening\" and that losing the scheme would be \"a big step in the wrong direction\". The government minister who oversees the scheme, Stuart Andrew MP, has now found a new charity to take over the parliament for a year. \"We had to have that slight pause - which was really distressing, we were sorry to see what happened,\" he told Newsround. \"But we felt the programme was so important, we are absolutely committed to it, that we\\'ve been working really hard to try and do everything we can to get this year\\'s programme back up and running again. \"It has been a worrying time for many members of the parliament, and I hope this announcement reassures them.\" More stories here How Parliament actually works Politicians \\'do listen\\' to children, says Children\\'s Commissioner Prime minister describes local election results as \\'disappointing\\' What is the UK Youth Parliament? Image source, Getty Images Image caption, MYPs get to meet in the House of Commons and discuss issues that matter to young people When you hear the word parliament, you might imagine grown-up politicians having debates and creating laws but did you know that the UK also has a parliament just for kids? Every two years, hundreds of 11 to 18 year olds are elected as MYPs. Elections are held across the country, with candidates making posters and knocking on doors to win votes. MYPs are responsible for speaking up about issues that matter to young people in their area, and making sure the adult politicians take notice. They hold debates, make speeches and run campaigns about all kinds of topics, from schools, to health and the environment. Did you know? The Youth Parliament met for the first time in 2001 after a campaign by a politician named Andrew Rowe. He believed children should have a say on the issues that matter to them. Shalom said she was worried when the charity British Youth Council closed down, leaving the parliament without anyone to run it. \"We\\'d just been elected in March, and it was only a few weeks after that we found out. \"This was slightly disheartening after all our hard work, we didn\\'t know if we\\'d be able to do our roles as MYPs.\" Image caption, Muhammad Ammaar and Shalom said they were happy the Youth Parliament was set to get started again Muhammad Ammaar, another new MYP, said the parliament was \"a crucial structure for young people to get heard and make change in our society\". He said: \"If there is no youth parliament, how are young people supposed to get involved in politics?\" Research in March from the Children\\'s Commissioner for England found that four in five kids don\\'t feel listened to by politicians. It also discovered that only one in 10 teenagers feel they can have an impact on issues that they care about. Shalom says it\\'s really important that kids get involved in politics. She said: \"Us young people, we\\'re the future of this country. \"And if we don\\'t have an impact on the decisions that are made that will affect us, then what\\'s the next generation going to be like?\" Image caption, Stuart Andrew MP first got involved with politics at the age of 14 Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Sport, Gambling and Civil Society Stuart Andrew said the charity National Youth Agency would be taking over running the Youth Parliament for the next year, while he spends the next few months creating a longer term plan.

       " 'Public inquiry into infilled Congham bridge expected to start': ['Public inquiry into infilled bridge due to start Image source, National Highways Image caption, Congham Bridge in December 2009, showing a tree growing into wingwall and propping of the deck Owen Sennitt & Mariam Issimdar Local Democracy Reporting Service & BBC News, Norfolk Published 3 hours ago A three-year long battle to force National Highways to remove concrete used to infill a historic bridge is to be decided by the planning inspector at a public inquiry. So why was the Congham Bridge near King\\'s Lynn filled in and why is a public inquiry being held? What is infilling of a bridge? According to National Highways, \"infilling is when we support a bridge by placing structural fill material under the whole of the arch to prop it up from underneath\". The material is usually crushed stone, recycled building material and foamed concrete. A century after Congham Bridge was opened, it had become corroded and began to develop fractures. This led to National Highways deciding to fill it in with concrete in 2021, arguing it had “serious structural issues” meaning it had become unsafe and that it was the most cost-effective action it could take. Image source, The HRE Group Image caption, The Congham Bridge is the subject of a public inquiry to decide if concrete should be removed from within and the bridge restored Why was the action controversial? It was supposed to be a temporary measure. Highways England said the work carried out was an emergency measure to support the structure - but it later broke permitted development regulations when it failed to remove the concrete within 12 months. In October, King\\'s Lynn and West Norfolk Borough councillors rejected an attempt by National Highways to apply for retrospective permission for the work to be made permanent. Instead, the council took enforcement action against National Highways. A public inquiry at the Duke\\'s Head Hotel in King\\'s Lynn, due to start on 21 May, will see officials from the Planning Inspectorate - the government department that presides over planning disputes - hearing evidence from both sides before making a judgement. Why is the bridge special? Congham Bridge is one of just six which were built in the 1920s by William Marriott, engineer of the Midland and Great Northern Railway, featuring curved wingwalls and a \"rare surviving example of an early modular concrete structure\". The railway route once connected South Lynn with Fakenham before continuing on to Great Yarmouth. The line closed in 1959, preceding the Beeching cuts the following decade, which led to vast sections of the railway network to shut. But the bridge has remained in use, carrying a quiet country road, St Andrews Lane, across the now-abandoned track. Heritage groups claim the structural issues were misrepresented and that it should have been repaired to preserve this piece of railway history. Image source, National Highways Image caption, Damage in a bridge beam in 2019 What do all the groups want to happen next? Michael de Whalley, chairman of Congham Parish Council, said in December: \"National Highways\\' actions were very frustrating. \"There are fantastic possibilities if it is reopened, but how do you maintain a bridge if it is encased in concrete?\" The parish council had hoped the work would be undone so the bridge \"can be used as something more constructive such as a cycleway or greenway\". Hélène Rossiter, head of the Historical Railways Estate , external at National Highways, said recently that infill was \"essential to ensure the bridge can carry traffic safely\". \"We do not feel the council\\'s decision adequately reflects the safety concerns raised, which is why we are lodging an appeal with the Planning Inspectorate.\" Meanwhile, Graeme Bickerdike, of the Heritage Railway Estate Group , external , which wants the infill removed, claimed new information had revealed a “clearer picture” about the circumstances and decision-making that resulted in the bridge’s infilling. What happens at the inquiry? Thousands of statements and pieces of evidence have been submitted ahead of the inquiry and experts will appear before the inspector at the meeting. The Public Inspectorate will hear both sides of the argument before making its decision at a later date. Congham Bridge is one of 51 bridges that have been infilled since 2013 at a cost of £8m, according to the Heritage Railway Estates Group. Engineers have recently completed digging out hundreds of tonnes of concrete from Great Musgrave Bridge in Cumbria after Eden District Council ordered it to restore the Victorian structure last year.

       " 'The British island and the Nazi labour camps': ['The British island and the Nazi labour camps Image source, BBC Image caption, There were four Nazi camps on the island of Alderney, which measures three square miles (8 sq km) Charlotte Cox BBC News Published 3 hours ago During World War Two, a small island just 70 miles off the English coast became part of Hitler\\'s strategy for dominance - and home to the only Nazi concentration camp on British soil. Alderney is the northernmost of the inhabited Channel Islands, which were occupied by the Germans in 1940. Most of the 1,500 residents had been evacuated to the UK but a small number remained, living an often precarious existence in the shadow of forced/slave labour camps. Historical archives show prisoners from 27 countries were held in brutal conditions, subjected to inhumane treatment at four camps, including the SS-run Lager Sylt, with an investigation after the island\\'s liberation in 1945 finding 389 inmates died. Many experts believe the figure is higher, while others, including some Alderney islanders, have expressed frustration at \"speculation\" around this horrific period in history and its impact on the island. The UK Holocaust Memorial Foundation has tasked a panel of 11 international experts with finding an accurate figure for those who lost their lives and investigating why no UK war crime trials were held for those responsible, with findings due to be announced on Wednesday. Lord Pickles, the UK\\'s Holocaust envoy who ordered the review, said: \"Numbers matter because the truth matters. The dead deserve the dignity of the truth; the residents of Alderney deserve accurate numbers to free them from the distortion of conspiracy theorists.\" Image caption, Lager Sylt was taken over by SS officers in 1943 As the Germans advanced westwards in 1940, the Channel Islands were demilitarised by the British Government because they were considered to be \"of little strategic value\", according to Trevor Davenport, author of Festung Alderney - a book on German defences in the island. Unaware of the withdrawal of the military, the Germans bombed St Helier and St Peter Port on 28 June, before occupying Guernsey on 30 June, Jersey on 1 July, Alderney on 2 July and Sark on 4 July. Bombing of St Helier and St Peter Port remembered Footprints a reminder of childhood under occupation Secrets of Guernsey WW2 underground newspaper revealed Renewed calls to addressing German Occupation injustices Over the following years, the Channel Islands were clawed into Hitler\\'s plans to create \"staging posts\" to invade Britain, as well as creating the so-called \"Atlantikwall\\' - or Atlantic Wall - to defend the coastline of Europe from Norway to the Spanish border. Image caption, There were four camps on Alderney, one of which was taken over by the SS Image source, Getty Images Image caption, The Channel Islands were occupied for five years The construction was carried out by Organisation Todt (OT), made up of largely forced foreign labourers - mostly slave workers from Russia - many of whom suffered harsh, cruel and inhumane treatment, according to historians. In Alderney the OT labourers were housed in four camps - Lager Helgoland, Lager Norderney, Lager Borkum and Lager Sylt - named after German islands. According to archives, Lager Sylt, near the Telegraph Tower, was taken over in March 1943 by the SS, part of the so-called death\\'s head formation that ran concentration camps. During that year, the number of forced labourers on the island reached more than 4,000, while there were said to be 3,200 German soldiers in the garrison. Image caption, Gary Font\\'s father was a prisoner in Alderney British military investigator Capt Theodore Pantcheff arrived in Alderney in 1945, shortly after the island was liberated and in a book he authored said he had interviewed more than 3,000 witnesses and potential perpetrators. Capt Pantcheff described \"exceptionally hard work\", for \"undernourished\" prisoners whose rations were habitually diverted to the SS canteen, including digging trenches of cable in \"rocky soil\". Medical care was \"nominal\" he said, while he also cited witness accounts of prisoners being punished, beaten, hanged and shot. The SS Baubrigade 1 left Sylt Camp and it was closed in June 1944, said Capt Pantcheff, with the camp then destroyed \"and used by the armed forces as construction material elsewhere and for firewood\". His son Andrew Pantcheff said his father had known Alderney before the war because his aunt and uncle were pre-war doctors on the island. Mr Pantcheff said his father \"made himself ill\", in part due to the emotional impact of what he heard and saw on Alderney. Image caption, Andrew Pantcheff said his father was exasperated over the lack of prosecutions for what happened on Alderney Capt Pantcheff also identified perpetrators - one of whom went to prison in Europe, said Mr Pantcheff, but not for his actions in Alderney. \"The problem here is there was a conflict but because there were no prosecutions we don\\'t have the resolutions to it, in which case there are a lot of rumours and speculation and so on.\" He said his father was \"exasperated\" over the lack of prosecutions: \"For political reasons... someone in Whitehall somewhere made sure there weren\\'t and I don\\'t know why.\" The inquiry has been extended to include an investigation into this lack of prosecutions within the UK. Image source, Jersey Heritage Image caption, Gordon Prigent was transported to Alderney and made to work for the Germans \\'He had nightmares\\' Iris Prigent, 88, said her husband Gordon Prigent was 19 and living in Jersey in 1943 when the Germans demanded he work for them. Unhappy that he should be expected to work for the people who had occupied his island, Mr Prigent refused - and the German authorities punished him severely before transporting him to Alderney. Mr Prigent was forced to carry out a variety of jobs, on a meagre diet and with regular beatings. Mrs Prigent said: \"Some nights he had nightmares - we\\'d be in bed and I\\'d be woken up with \\'Achtung, Achtung, Achtung!\\' [attention], and he\\'d be standing next to the bed, talking, you know, to a German who wasn\\'t there.\" Image source, Jersey Heritage Image caption, Gordon Prigent suffered with nightmares after his experience \\'Terrible things happened here\\' Gary Font\\'s father was Spanish Republican forced worker Francisco Font, who spent nine months as a slave worker in Lager Norderney. He said as a child he and his father would visit the Hammond Memorial, overlooking Longis Common, where historians have said liberating troops found a \"large burial ground\". He said he \"understood\" there was a possibility that many more had died \"than we were told\". \"I always look at Alderney... not so much a place where you would go to to enjoy the scenery - even thought it\\'s a beautiful island - for me it\\'s an island where so many people were persecuted and were buried and terrible things happened there. \"Fortunately the good people of Alderney have always commemorated the people who never made it back to their homes.\" He said during visits to Alderney he would see a different side to his father: \"I can\\'t help but think he suffered some terrible nightmares and saw some terrible things.\" Image caption, Prisoners, including those at the SS-run Lager Sylt, lost their lives during the brutal occupation As part of the inquiry, which has included field trips of panel members to Alderney and a review of archives from across the world as well as those documents kept on the island, a website was launched to \"detail the Nazi occupation of Alderney\". There is ongoing debate over whether more should be done to commemorate those who lost their lives, while there has been dispute over appropriate use of the Longis Common site . Alderney resident and Jurat Colin Partridge OBE said the inquiry, led by Lord Eric Pickles, would \"draw attention to the various sites on the island and hopefully that will encourage a programme for memorialisation suitable to the size and scale of the island\". He told the BBC his expertise lay in the \"construction programme\" and the objective of the inquiry was to \"separate evidence from speculation\". Mr Partridge said he hoped the inquiry would \"open up other source of information\" as a \"foundation on which to build\". \"I think it\\'s important we record the names of all those who we can identify, many of them of course were forced from their home surroundings to cross Europe to come to a place they\\'d never heard of. \"Those who died here are forgotten in the sense their families would never have known where they died, I think we owe to them and their descendants to record those names.\" Image caption, Colin Partridge MBE is the only panel member from Alderney He said various books alongside \"interest in the national press\" had \"complicated the issue\". Mr Partridge said there had been \"many sources\" over the years but the \"archives are incomplete\". One amateur historian from Guernsey, who asked not to be identified, criticised \"speculation\" about the occupation by \"people with agendas\". He added: \"Without a doubt, Alderney was a harsh place to be a forced worker, people lost their lives. \"But we don\\'t want the truth twisted, the idea was that people came to Alderney to work, not to be killed as was the case in mainland Europe.\" Image caption, Members of the public and church leaders came together to mark Holocaust Memorial Day in January Dr Gilly Carr, a specialist in Holocaust heritage at Cambridge University, is also a panel member. Originally the Channel Islands representative for the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, her appointment was later rescinded after comments she made during a seminar. Dr Carr said they used archives \"from across mainland Europe, Israel, Moscow and Ukraine\" to inform their findings. She said an unprecedented amount of evidence combined with \"decades of experience\" had resulted in their \"completion of the task\". Dr Carr added: \"We calculated and worked out the number of dead and the number of labourers.\" She said the number was \"a lot higher\" than the official figure of old. Dr Carr said a lot of alternative theories had been \"floated over the last couple of years\". She said these included \"grossly-inflated numbers\" unsupported by evidence. \"It\\'s important to find out the answer to the question because this has been a subject so distorted over the last few years and highjacked by people with different agendas so it\\'s just really important to find out the truth for their sake and in memory of the dead. \"The truth matters.\" Dr Kathrin Meyer, secretary of the The International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA), sad: \"Dealing openly and accurately with the Holocaust and the history of Nazi persecution of other groups in all its dimensions is crucial. \"We expect the results to go a long way in protecting the facts, no matter how uncomfortable they may be.\" Follow BBC Guernsey on X (formerly Twitter) , external and Facebook , external .

Jersey\\'s politicians will be voting on proposals on how assisted dying could work after the principle of legalising it was approved in 2021. Proposals for how an assisted dying law on the island would work were published in March. Tom Binet, Health and Social Services Minister, said proposals had been “very much influenced and informed by the views of islanders.\" Five votes He said: \"I think all the indications are that a majority of people actually want this.\" Mr Binet said voting might not start until Wednesday. Five votes will take place. The first will be on whether the island should establish an assisted dying service for adults who have made a voluntary and informed decision to die. States Assembly members will also be asked to vote on limiting eligibility to people with a terminal illness with a life expectancy of six months, or 12 months if they have a neurodegenerative disease. This is known as route one. Elected representatives will also vote on whether the service should be open to someone with an incurable physical condition which might not be terminal but is causing them unbearable suffering, known as route two. Another vote offers an opt-out for health professionals, giving them a right to refuse to participate in assisted dying. A fifth vote asks members to agree on minimum timeframes between the first formal request for an assisted death and the act itself – 14 days for route one and 90 days under route two. If the proposals are voted through, it is expected the process for drafting a law could take about 18 months, with a debate then taking place by the end of 2025. If a law is approved, it is expected a further 18-month implementation period will then begin, meaning the earliest for it to come into effect would be summer 2027.
