Introducing "DailyLink" - Your Personalised Daily News Recommender.

DailyLink is an innovative web app that transforms your news consumption experience by serving as your personalised daily news recommender. Leveraging the latest advancements in machine learning, DailyLink curates a tailored selection of news articles that match your interests and preferences, ensuring you stay informed about the topics that matter most to you.

At the core of DailyLink's intelligent recommendation system lies semi-supervised learning, a powerful technique that automatically labels the news articles scraped from a diverse range of reputable news websites. This labeling process ensures that the app understands the content and relevance of each article, enabling it to identify and categorise articles based on various topics.

To provide you with the most relevant and comprehensive news coverage, DailyLink employs LLM embeddings and cosine similarity scores. These advanced technologies assess the similarity between articles, allowing the app to identify related news pieces that align with your interests. As a result, you receive a curated selection of articles that cover various angles of the topics you care about.

DailyLink's true uniqueness emerges with its Active Learning Suggestion Model. At the outset, the extension takes your explicit preferences into account to suggest relevant articles. However, the magic truly happens as the system learns from your daily interactions. By analysing your engagement duration and clickthrough rate on each article, DailyLink gains invaluable insights into your preferences and interests.

As you continue to use the extension, DailyLink optimises its recommendation algorithm, delivering increasingly accurate and personalized news suggestions that align perfectly with your evolving interests. This iterative learning process ensures that the news you receive becomes more and more tailored to your preferences over time.
